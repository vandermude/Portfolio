		Graphing Whole Numbers 1.2.2 Numbers and NumeralsWe begin our study of introductory mathematics by examining its most basic building block, the number. NumberA number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. The earliest concept of a number was a thought that allowed people to mentally picture the size of some collection of objects. To write down the number being conceptualized, a numeral is used. NumeralA numeral is a symbol that represents a number. In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this common usage. 1.2.2.1 Sample Set A The following are numerals. In each case, the rst represents the number four, the second represents the num- ber one hundred twenty-three, and the third, the number one thousand ve. These numbers are represented in dierent ways.

PAGE	'1.2.3 The Hindu-Arabic Numeration System'
Hindu-Arabic Numeration SystemOur society uses the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. This system of numeration began shortly before the third century when the Hindus invented the numerals

Leonardo FibonacciAbout a thousand years later, in the thirteenth century, a mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa introduced the system into Europe. It was then popularized by the Arabs. Thus, the name, Hindu-Arabic numeration system.
PAGE	'1.2.4 The Base Ten Positional Number System'
DigitsThe Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding."
Base Ten Positional SystemsIt is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten.
CommasWhen numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three.
PeriodsThese groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers.
In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are
Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name.
As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The ve periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sucient.
The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.)


# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number.
1.2.4.1 Sample Set B
Example 1.1
Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261.
Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens.
6 tens = 60
Example 1.2
Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005.
Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions.
9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million
Example 1.3
Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001.
Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand

Whole NumbersNumbers that are formed using only the digits 0123456789are called whole numbers. They are0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, . . .
The three dots at the end mean "and so on in this same pattern."
PAGE	'1.2.6 Graphing Whole Numbers'
Number LineWhole numbers may be visualized by constructing a number line. To construct a number line, we simply draw a straight line and choose any point on the line and label it 0.
OriginThis point is called the origin. We then choose some convenient length, and moving to the right, mark o consecutive intervals (parts) along the line starting at 0. We label each new interval endpoint with the next whole number.
GraphingWe can visually display a whole number by drawing a closed circle at the point labeled with that whole number. Another phrase for visually displaying a whole number is graphing the whole number. The word graph means to "visually display."
1.2.6.1 Sample Set C
Example 1.4
Graph the following whole numbers: 3, 5, 9.
Example 1.5
Specify the whole numbers that are graphed on the following number line. The break in the number line indicates that we are aware of the whole numbers between 0 and 106, and 107 and 872, but we are not listing them due to space limitations.

1.4 Rounding Whole Numbers
PAGE	'1.4.1 Section Overview'
		Rounding as an Approximation
		The Method of Rounding Numbers
A primary use of whole numbers is to keep count of how many objects there are in a collection. Sometimes we're only interested in the approximate number of objects in the collection rather than the precise number. For example, there are approximately 20 symbols in the collection below.
The precise number of symbols in the above collection is 18.
RoundingWe often approximate the number of objects in a collection by mentally seeing the collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc. This process of approximation is called rounding. Rounding is very useful in estimation. We will study estimation in Chapter 8.
When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of tens, we say we're rounding to the nearest ten. When we think of a collection as occurring in groups of hundreds, we say we're rounding to the nearest hundred. This idea of rounding continues through thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, etc.
The process of rounding whole numbers is illustrated in the following examples.
Example 1.12
Round 67 to the nearest ten.




# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
On the number line, 67 is more than halfway from 60 to 70. The digit immediately to the right of the tens digit, the round-o digit, is the indicator for this.

est ten, is 70.
Example 1.13
Round 4,329 to the nearest hundred.
On the number line, 4,329 is less than halfway from 4,300 to 4,400. The digit to the immediate right of the hundreds digit, the round-o digit, is the indicator.
nearest hundred is 4,300.
Example 1.14
Round 16,500 to the nearest thousand.
On the number line, 16,500 is exactly halfway from 16,000 to 17,000.
By convention, when the number to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers, it is rounded to the higher number.
Thus, 16,500, rounded to the nearest thousand, is 17,000.
Example 1.15
A person whose salary is $41,450 per year might tell a friend that she makes $41,000 per year. She
has rounded 41,450 to the nearest thousand. The number 41,450 is closer to 41,000 than it is to 42,000.
Thus, 67, rounded to the near-

Thus, 4,329, rounded to the

PAGE	'1.4.3 The Method of Rounding Whole Numbers'
From the observations made in the preceding examples, we can use the following method to round a whole number to a particular position.
1. Mark the position of the round-o digit.2. Note the digit to the immediate right of the round-o digit.

a. If it is less than 5, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Leave the round-o digit unchanged.
b. If it is 5 or larger, replace it and all the digits to its right with zeros. Increase the round-o digit by 1.
1.4.3.1 Sample Set AUse the method of rounding whole numbers to solve the following problems.
Example 1.16
Round 3,426 to the nearest ten.
	1.	We are rounding to the tens position. Mark the digit in the tens position
	2.	Observe the digit immediately to the right of the tens position. It is 6. Since 6 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 6 with 0 and adding 1 to the digit in the tens position (the round-o position): 2 + 1 = 3 .3,430
Thus, 3,426 rounded to the nearest ten is 3,430.
Example 1.17
Round 9,614,018,007 to the nearest ten million.
	1.	We are rounding to the nearest ten million.
	2.	Observe the digit immediately to the right of the ten millions position. It is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we round down by replacing 4 and all the digits to its right with zeros. 9,610,000,000
Thus, 9,614,018,007 rounded to the nearest ten million is 9,610,000,000.
Example 1.18
Round 148,422 to the nearest million.
	1.	Since we are rounding to the nearest million, we'll have to imagine a digit in the millions position. We'll write 148,422 as 0,148,422.
	2.	The digit immediately to the right is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we'll round down by replacing it and all the digits to its right with zeros.0,000,000This number is 0.


# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Thus, 148,422 rounded to the nearest million is 0.
Example 1.19
Round 397,000 to the nearest ten thousand.
	1.	We are rounding to the nearest ten thousand.
	2.	The digit immediately to the right of the ten thousand position is 7. Since 7 is greater than 5, we round up by replacing 7 and all the digits to its right with zeros and adding 1 to the digit in the ten thousands position. But 9 + 1 = 10 and we must carry the 1 to the next (the hundred thousands) position.

 Calculators
PAGE	'1.5.2 AdditionSuppose we have two collections of objects that we combine together to form a third collection. For example,'
We are combining a collection of four objects with a collection of three objects to obtain a collection of seven objects.
AdditionThe process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a third, the total, is called addition.
In addition, the numbers being added are called addends or terms, and the total is called the sum. The plus symbol (+) is used to indicate addition, and the equal symbol (=) is used to represent the word "equal." For example, 4 + 3 = 7 means "four added to three equals seven."
PAGE	'1.5.3 Addition Visualized on the Number Line'
Addition is easily visualized on the number line. Let's visualize the addition of 4 and 3 using the number line.
To nd 4 + 3,
1. Start at 0.2. Move to the right 4 units. We are now located at 4.3. From 4, move to the right 3 units. We are now located at 7.
Thus, 4 + 3 = 7.
PAGE	'1.5.4 The Addition ProcessWe'll study the process of addition by considering the sum of 25 and 43.'

# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
PAGE	'1.5.5 Addition Involving Carrying'
It often happens in addition that the sum of the digits in a column will exceed 9. This happens when we add 18 and 34. We show this in expanded form as follows.
Notice that when we add the 8 ones to the 4 ones we get 12 ones. We then convert the 12 ones to 1 ten and 2 ones. In vertical addition, we show this conversion by carrying the ten to the tens column. We write a 1 at the top of the tens column to indicate the carry. This same example is shown in a shorter form as follows:
8 + 4 = 12 Write 2, carry 1 ten to the top of the next column to the left.
1.5.5.1 Sample Set BPerform the following additions. Use the process of carrying when needed.

Example 1.23
Add 1875 and 358.
5 + 8 = 131 + 7 + 5 = 13 1 + 8 + 3 = 12 1+1=2
The sum is 2233.
Write 3, carry 1 ten. Write 3, carry 1 hundred. Write 2, carry 1 thousand.

Example 1.24
Add 89,208 and 4,946.

8 + 6 = 141 + 0 + 4 = 5 2 + 9 = 111 + 9 + 4 = 14 1+8=9
The sum is 94,154.
Example 1.25
Add 38 and 95.
8 + 5 = 131 + 3 + 9 = 13 1+0=1
Write 4, carry 1 ten. Write the 5 (nothing to carry). Write 1, carry one thousand. Write 4, carry one ten thousand.


Write 3, carry 1 ten. Write 3, carry 1 hundred.
As you proceed with the addition, it is a good idea to keep in mind what is actually happening.
The sum is 133.
Example 1.26
Find the sum 2648, 1359, and 861.

8 + 9 + 1 = 181 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 16 1 + 6 + 3 + 8 = 18 1+2+1=4
Write 8, carry 1 ten. Write 6, carry 1 hundred. Write 8, carry 1 thousand.
The sum is 4,868.Numbers other than 1 can be carried as illustrated in Example 1.27.
Example 1.27
Find the sum of the following numbers.

# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS

PAGE	'1.6.2 Subtraction'
SubtractionSubtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the total is removed.
Suppose the sum of two whole numbers is 11, and from 11 we remove 4. Using the number line to help our visualization, we see that if we are located at 11 and move 4 units to the left, and thus remove 4 units, we will be located at 7. Thus, 7 units remain when we remove 4 units from 11 units.
The Minus SymbolThe minus symbol (-) is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 11  4 indicates that 4 is to be subtracted from 11.
MinuendThe number immediately in front of or the minus symbol is called the minuend, and it represents the original number of units.
SubtrahendThe number immediately following or below the minus symbol is called the subtrahend, and it represents the number of units to be removed.
DierenceThe result of the subtraction is called the dierence of the two numbers. For example, in 11  4 = 7, 11 is the minuend, 4 is the subtrahend, and 7 is the dierence.
PAGE	'1.6.3 Subtraction as the Opposite of AdditionSubtraction can be thought of as the opposite of addition. We show this in the problems in Sample Set A.'

# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
PAGE	'1.6.5 Subtraction Involving Borrowing'
Minuend and SubtrahendIt often happens in the subtraction of two whole numbers that a digit in the minuend (top number) will be less than the digit in the same position in the subtrahend (bottom number). This happens when we subtract 27 from 84.
84 27
We do not have a name for 4  7. We need to rename 84 in order to continue. We'll do so as follows:
Our new name for 84 is 7 tens + 14 ones.
= 57
Notice that we converted 8 tens to 7 tens + 1 ten, and then we converted the 1 ten to 10 ones. We then had 14 ones and were able to perform the subtraction.
BorrowingThe process of borrowing (converting) is illustrated in the problems of Sample Set C.
1.6.5.1 Sample Set C
Example 1.38!!!
1. Borrow 1 ten from the 8 tens. This leaves 7 tens. 2. Convert the 1 ten to 10 ones.3. Add 10 ones to 4 ones to get 14 ones.
Example 1.39
1. Borrow 1 hundred from the 6 hundreds. This leaves 5 hundreds.

PAGE	'1.6.6 Borrowing from Zero'
It often happens in a subtraction problem that we have to borrow from one or more zeros. This occurs in problems such as

 37 and

 37We'll examine each case.
Example 1.43
 Borrowing from a single zero.

 37Since we do not have a name for 3  7, we must borrow from 0.
Since there are no tens to borrow, we must borrow 1 hundred. One hundred = 10 tens.
We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens (leaving 9 tens). One ten = 10 ones and 10 ones + 3 ones = 13 ones.
Now we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a single zero.
Borrowing from a Single Zero To borrow from a single zero,
1. Decrease the digit to the immediate left of zero by one. 2. Draw a line through the zero and make it a 10.3. Proceed to subtract as usual.

Example 1.45
 Borrowing from a group of zeros
5000  37
In this case, we have a group of zeros.

Consider the problem

Since we cannot borrow any tens or hundreds, we must borrow 1 thousand. One thousand = 10 hundreds.
We can now borrow 1 hundred from 10 hundreds. One hundred = 10 tens.

We can now borrow 1 ten from 10 tens. One ten = 10 ones.
From observations made in this procedure we can suggest the following method for borrowing from a group of zeros.
Borrowing from a Group of zeros To borrow from a group of zeros,
1. Decrease the digit to the immediate left of the group of zeros by one.2. Draw a line through each zero in the group and make it a 9, except the rightmost zero, make it 10. 3. Proceed to subtract as usual.

8 1.8 Summary of Key Concepts
PAGE	'1.8.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Number / Numeral (Section 1.2)A number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. A numeral is a symbol that represents a number. It is customary not to distinguish between the two (but we should remain aware of the dierence).
Hindu-Arabic Numeration System (Section 1.2)In our society, we use the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. It was invented by the Hindus shortly before the third century and popularized by the Arabs about a thousand years later.
Digits (Section 1.2)The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are called digits.
Base Ten Positional System (Section 1.2)The Hindu-Arabic numeration system is a positional number system with base ten. Each position has value that is ten times the value of the position to its right.
Commas / Periods (Section 1.2)Commas are used to separate digits into groups of three. Each group of three is called a period. Each period has a name. From right to left, they are ones, thousands, millions, billions, etc.
Whole Numbers (Section 1.2)A whole number is any number that is formed using only the digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
Number Line (Section 1.2)The number line allows us to visually display the whole numbers.
Graphing (Section 1.2)Graphing a whole number is a term used for visually displaying the whole number. The graph of 4 appears below.
Reading Whole Numbers (Section 1.3) To express a whole number as a verbal phrase:
1. Begin at the right and, working right to left, separate the number into distinct periods by inserting commas every three digits.
2. Begin at the left, and read each period individually.
Writing Whole Numbers (Section 1.3)To rename a number that is expressed in words to a number expressed in digits:


1. Notice that a number expressed as a verbal phrase will have its periods set o by commas. 2. Start at the beginning of the sentence, and write each period of numbers individually.3. Use commas to separate periods, and combine the periods to form one number.
Rounding (Section 1.4)Rounding is the process of approximating the number of a group of objects by mentally "seeing" the collection as occurring in groups of tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.
Addition (Section 1.5)Addition is the process of combining two or more objects (real or intuitive) to form a new, third object, the total, or sum.
Addends / Sum (Section 1.5)In addition, the numbers being added are called addends and the result, or total, the sum.
Subtraction (Section 1.6)Subtraction is the process of determining the remainder when part of the total is removed.
Minuend / Subtrahend Dierence (Section 1.6)
Commutative Property of Addition (Section 1.7)If two whole numbers are added in either of two orders, the sum will not change. 3+5=5+3
Associative Property of Addition (Section 1.7)If three whole numbers are to be added, the sum will be the same if the rst two are added and that sum is then added to the third, or if the second two are added and the rst is added to that sum.(3 + 5) + 2 = 3 + (5 + 2)
Parentheses in Addition (Section 1.7)Parentheses in addition indicate which numbers are to be added rst.
Additive Identity (Section 1.7)The whole number 0 is called the additive identity since, when it is added to any particular whole number, the sum is identical to that whole number.0+7=77+0=7

Therefore, we say we have three times ve and describe it by writing 35Thus, 35=5+5+5 MultiplicandIn a multiplication, the repeated addend (number being added) is called the multiplicand. In 3  5, the 5 is the multiplicand. MultiplierAlso, in a multiplication, the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is called the multiplier. In 3  5, the 3 is the multiplier. 2.2.2.1 Sample Set AExpress each repeated addition as a multiplication. In each case, specify the multiplier and the multiplicand.

1: First Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the ones digit of the multiplier. This product is called the rst partial product.
2: Second Partial Product Multiply the multiplicand by the tens digit of the multiplier. This product is called the second partial product. Since the tens digit is used as a factor, the second partial product is written below the rst partial product so that its rightmost digit appears in the tens column.

In the process of division, the concern is how many times one number is contained in another number. For example, we might be interested in how many 5's are contained in 15. The word times is signicant because it implies a relationship between division and multiplication.
There are several notations used to indicate division. Suppose Q records the number of times 5 is contained in 15. We can indicate this by writing
Q
5)15
  
5 into 15
15/5=Q   
15 divided by 5
15 = Q 5
  
15 divided by 5
15 5=Q   
15 divided by 5

Each of these division notations describes the same number, represented here by the symbol Q. Each notation also converts to the same multiplication form. It is 15 = 5  Q
In division,
Dividendthe number being divided into is called the dividend.
Divisorthe number dividing into the dividend is the divisor.
Quotientthe result of the division is called the quotient.

Let's look at what happens when the dividend (the number being divided into) is zero, and the divisor (the number doing the dividing) is any whole number except zero. The question is
What number, if any, is 0 ? any nonzero whole number
Let's represent this unknown quotient by Q. Then,

Converting this division problem to its corresponding multiplication problem, we get
0 = Q  (any nonzero whole number)
From our knowledge of multiplication, we can understand that if the product of two whole numbers is zero, then one or both of the whole numbers must be zero. Since any nonzero whole number is certainly not zero, Q must represent zero. Then,

=Q any nonzero whole number


=0
Zero Divided By Any Nonzero Whole Number Is Zero Zero divided any nonzero whole number is zero.
PAGE	'2.3.4 Division by Zero (Zero as a Divisor:a , a = 0) 0'
Now we ask,
What number, if any, is 0 ?
Letting Q represent a possible quotient, we get
any nonzero whole number = Q 0
Converting to the corresponding multiplication form, we have

any nonzero whole number

any nonzero whole number

# CHAPTER 2. MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF WHOLE NUMBERS (any nonzero whole number) = Q  0
Since Q  0 = 0, (any nonzero whole number) = 0. But this is absurd. This would mean that 6 = 0, or 37 = 0. A nonzero whole number cannot equal 0! Thus,
any nonzero whole number

does not name a number

Division by Zero is UndenedDivision by zero does not name a number. It is, therefore, undened.
PAGE	'2.3.5 Division by and Into Zero (Zero as a Dividend and Divisor:0) 0'
We are now curious about zero divided by zero 0. If we let Q represent a potential quotient, we get 0
0=Q 0
Converting to the multiplication form,
0=Q0This results in0=0This is a statement that is true regardless of the number used in place of Q. For example,
0 =5,since0=50. 0
0 =31,since0=310. 0
0 =286,since0=2860. 0
A unique quotient cannot be determined. Indeterminant
Since the result of the division is inconclusive, we say that 0 is indeterminant. 0

		Division with a Single Digit Divisor

		Division with a Remainder  Calculators
Our experience with multiplication of whole numbers allows us to perform such divisions as 755. We perform the division by performing the corresponding multiplication, 5  Q = 75. Each division we considered in Section 2.3 had a one-digit quotient. Now we will consider divisions in which the quotient may consist of two or more digits. For example, 75  5.
Let's examine the division 75  5. We are asked to determine how many 5's are contained in 75. We'll approach the problem in the following way.
	1.	Make an educated guess based on experience with multiplication.
	2.	Find how close the estimate is by multiplying the estimate by 5.
	3.	If the product obtained in step 2 is less than 75, nd out how much less by subtracting it from 75.
	4.	If the product obtained in step 2 is greater than 75, decrease the estimate until the product is less than 75. Decreasing the estimate makes sense because we do not wish to exceed 75.
We can suggest from this discussion that the process of division consists of The Four Steps in Division
1. an educated guess2. a multiplication3. a subtraction4. bringing down the next digit (if necessary)
The educated guess can be made by determining how many times the divisor is contained in the dividend by using only one or two digits of the dividend.

Now determine how close the estimate is.10 ves is 10  5 = 50. Subtract 50 from 75. Estimate the number of 5's in 25.There are exactly 5 ves in 25.

10 ves + 5 ves = 15 ves. There are 15 ves contained in 75.

Divide: 5 goes into 25 exactly 5 times.

8 goes into 49 at most 6 times, and 9 is in the hundreds column. We'll guess 600. Then, 8  600 = 4800.

8 goes into 64 exactly 8 times.600 eights + 10 eights + 8 eights = 618 eights.
Check:Thus, 4, 944  8 = 618.
As in the rst problem, the notation in this division can be shortened by eliminating the subtraction signs and the zeros in each educated guess.

The process of division also works when the divisor consists of two or more digits. We now make educated guesses using the rst digit of the divisor and one or two digits of the dividend.
2.4.3.1 Sample Set B Example 2.25
Find 2, 232  36. 36)2232
Use the rst digit of the divisor and the rst two digits of the dividend to make the educated guess. 3 goes into 22 at most 7 times.Try 7: 7  36 = 252 which is greater than 223. Reduce the estimate.Try6: 636=216whichislessthan223.

Multiply: 6  36 = 216. Write 216 below 223. Subtract: 223 - 216 = 7. Bring down the 2.
Divide 3 into 7 to estimate the number of times 36 goes into 72. The 3 goes into 7 at most 2 times.
Try 2: 2  36 = 72.
Check:
Thus, 2, 232  36 = 62. Example 2.26

First, the educated guess: 24  8 = 3. Then 3  802 = 2406, which is less than 2417. Use 3 as the guess. Since 3  802 = 2406, and 2406 has four digits, place the 3 above the fourth digit of the dividend.
Subtract: 2417 - 2406 = 11. Bring down the 2.
The divisor 802 goes into 112 at most 0 times. Use 0.

4 goes into 10 at most 2 times. 2  4 = 8. Write 8 below 0. 10 - 8 = 2.

Since 4 does not divide into 2 (the remainder is less than the divisor) and there are no digits to bring down to continue the process, we are done. We write
2R2 4) 10
8 2

or 10  4 = 2R2 
2 with remainder 2

# CHAPTER 2. MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Divide: 3 goes into 8 at most 2 times. Divide: 3 goes into 25 at most 8 times. { Multiply: 23=6. Write6below8. { Multiply: 38=24. Write24below25.
Subtract: 8 - 6 = 2. Bring down the 5. Subtract: 25 - 24 = 1.There are no more digits to bring down to continue the process. We are done. One is the remainder. Check: Multiply 28 and 3, then add 1.
28 3 84 +1 85
Thus, 85  3 = 28R1. Example 2.28

The calculator can be useful for nding quotients with single and multiple digit divisors. If, however, the division should result in a remainder, the calculator is unable to provide us with the particular value of the remainder. Also, some calculators (most nonscientic) are unable to perform divisions in which one of the numbers has more than eight digits.

We will now examine three simple but very important properties of multiplication.
PAGE	'2.6.2 The Commutative Property of Multiplication'
Commutative Property of MultiplicationThe product of two whole numbers is the same regardless of the order of the factors.
2.6.2.1 Sample Set A
Example 2.35

PAGE	'2.6.3 The Associative Property of Multiplication'


Associative Property of MultiplicationIf three whole numbers are multiplied, the product will be the same if the rst two are multiplied rst and then that product is multiplied by the third, or if the second two are multiplied rst and that product is multiplied by the rst. Note that the order of the factors is maintained.
It is a common mathematical practice to use parentheses to show which pair of numbers is to be combined rst.
2.6.3.1 Sample Set B

Multiplication (Section 2.2)Multiplication is a description of repeated addition.
7+7+7+7
  
7 appears 4 timesThis expression is described by writing 4 X 7.
Multiplicand/Multiplier/Product (Section 2.2)In a multiplication of whole numbers, the repeated addend is called the multiplicand, and the number that records the number of times the multiplicand is used is the multiplier. The result of the multiplication is the product.
Factors (Section 2.2)In a multiplication, the numbers being multiplied are also called factors. Thus, the multiplicand and the multiplier can be called factors.
Division (Section 2.3)Division is a description of repeated subtraction.
Dividend/Divisor/Quotient (Section 2.3)In a division, the number divided into is called the dividend, and the number dividing into the dividend is called the divisor. The result of the division is called the quotient.
quotient divisor)dividend
Division into Zero (Section 2.3)Zero divided by any nonzero whole number is zero.
Division by Zero (Section 2.3)Division by zero does not name a whole number. It is, therefore, undened. The quotient 0 is indeterminant.

Division by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 (Section 2.5)Division by the whole numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 can be determined by noting some certain properties of the particular whole number.
Commutative Property of Multiplication (Section 2.6)The product of two whole numbers is the same regardless of the order of the factors. 3  5 = 5  3
Associative Property of Multiplication (Section 2.6)If three whole numbers are to be multiplied, the product will be the same if the rst two are multiplied rst and then that product is multiplied by the third, or if the second two are multiplied rst and then that product is multiplied by the rst.(35)2 = 3(52)Note that the order of the factors is maintained.
Multiplicative Identity (Section 2.6)The whole number 1 is called the multiplicative identity since any whole number multiplied by 1 is not changed.

Exponential NotationWe have noted that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. Exponential notation is a description of repeated multiplication.
Suppose we have the repeated multiplication
88888
ExponentThe factor 8 is repeated 5 times. Exponential notation uses a superscript for the number of times the factor is repeated. The superscript is placed on the repeated factor, 85, in this case. The superscript is called an exponent.
The Function of an ExponentAn exponent records the number of identical factors that are repeated in a multiplication.
3.2.2.1 Sample Set AWrite the following multiplication using exponents.
Example 3.1
3  3. Since the factor 3 appears 2 times, we record this as
32Example 3.2
626262626262626262. Since the factor 62 appears 9 times, we record this as
629Expand (write without exponents) each number.
Example 3.3
124. The exponent 4 is recording 4 factors of 12 in a multiplication. Thus,
124 =12121212 Example 3.4
7063. The exponent 3 is recording 3 factors of 706 in a multiplication. Thus, 7063 =706706706

PAGE	'3.2.3 Reading Exponential Notation In a number such as 85,'
Base8 is called the base.
Exponent, Power5 is called the exponent, or power. 85 is read as "eight to the fth power," or more simply as "eight to the fth," or "the fth power of eight."
SquaredWhen a whole number is raised to the second power, it is said to be squared. The number 52 can be read as
5 to the second power, or 5 to the second, or5 squared.
CubedWhen a whole number is raised to the third power, it is said to be cubed. The number 53 can be read as
5 to the third power, or 5 to the third, or5 cubed.
When a whole number is raised to the power of 4 or higher, we simply say that that number is raised to that particular power. The number 58 can be read as
5 to the eighth power, or just 5 to the eighth.


PAGE	'3.2.4 Roots'
# CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS, ROOTS, AND FACTORIZATION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
In the English language, the word "root" can mean a source of something. In mathematical terms, the word "root" is used to indicate that one number is the source of another number through repeated multiplication.
Square RootWe know that 49 = 72, that is, 49 = 7  7. Through repeated multiplication, 7 is the source of 49. Thus, 7 is a root of 49. Since two 7's must be multiplied together to produce 49, the 7 is called the second or square root of 49.
Cube RootWe know that 8 = 23, that is, 8 = 222. Through repeated multiplication, 2 is the source of 8. Thus, 2 is a root of 8. Since three 2's must be multiplied together to produce 8, 2 is called the third or cube root of 8.
We can continue this way to see such roots as fourth roots, fth roots, sixth roots, and so on.
PAGE	'3.2.5 Reading Root NotationThere is a symbol used to indicate roots of a number. It is called the radical sign n'

The Radical Sign n 
The symbol n is called a radical sign and indicates the nth root of a number.
We discuss particular roots using the radical sign as follows:
Square Root





number indicates the square root of the number under the radical sign. It is customary to drop the 2 in


the radical sign when discussing square roots. The symbol sign.
2 49=7since77=7 =49
Cube Root
is understood to be the square root radical




number indicates the cube root of the number under the radical sign. 3 8=2since222=23 =8
Fourth Root




number indicates the fourth root of the number under the radical sign. 4 81=3since3333=34 =81


is called the radical sign.
Index5 is called the index. (The index describes the indicated root.)
Radicand32 is called the radicand.

In an expression such as
Radical Sign

32 is called a radical (or radical expression).
3.2.5.1 Sample Set B Find each root.
Example 3.5!!!
25 To determine the square root of 25, we ask, "What whole number squared equals 25?" From our experience with multiplication, we know this number to be 5. Thus,

3.3 Grouping Symbols and the Order of Operations
PAGE	'3.3.1 Section Overview'
		Grouping Symbols
		Multiple Grouping Symbols
		The Order of Operations  Calculators 3.3.2 Grouping Symbols
Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are the following:
( ), [ ], { }, Parentheses: ( ) Brackets: [ ] Braces: { } Bar:
In a computation in which more than one operation is involved, grouping symbols indicate which operation to perform rst. If possible, we perform operations inside grouping symbols rst.


3.3.2.1 Sample Set AIf possible, determine the value of each of the following.
Example 3.9!!!
9+(38)Since 3 and 8 are within parentheses, they are to be combined rst.
9+ (38) =9+24 = 33
Thus,
9 + (3  8) = 33 Example 3.10
(100)6Since 10  0 is undened, this operation is meaningless, and we attach no value to it. We write,
"undened."
3.3.2.2 Practice Set A
If possible, determine the value of each of the following. Exercise 3.3.1

PAGE	'3.3.3 Multiple Grouping Symbols'
When a set of grouping symbols occurs inside another set of grouping symbols, we perform the operations within the innermost set rst.


# CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS, ROOTS, AND FACTORIZATION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
3.3.3.1 Sample Set BDetermine the value of each of the following.
Example 3.11!!!
2+(83)(5+6)Combine 8 and 3 rst, then combine 5 and 6.
2 + 24  11 Now combine left to right. 2611

Example 3.12
10+[30(29)]
Combine 2 and 9 since they occur in the innermost set of parentheses.
10 + [30  18] Now combine 30 and 18. 10+12

31+{9+[1+(352)]} Exercise 3.3.12
{6[24(42)]}33.3.4 The Order of Operations
Sometimes there are no grouping symbols indicating which operations to perform rst. For example, suppose we wish to nd the value of 3+52. We could do either of two things:
Add 3 and 5, then multiply this sum by 2.
3+52 =82 = 16
Multiply 5 and 2, then add 3 to this product.
3+52 =3+10 = 13
We now have two values for one number. To determine the correct value, we must use the accepted order of operations.
Order of Operations
	1.	Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order 2, 3, 4 described below,
	2.	Perform all exponential and root operations.
	3.	Perform all multiplications and divisions, moving left to right.
	4.	Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right.

		The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number 3.4.2 FactorsFrom observations made in the process of multiplication, we have seen that (factor)  (factor) = product
Factors, ProductThe two numbers being multiplied are the factors and the result of the multiplication is the product. Now, using our knowledge of division, we can see that a rst number is a factor of a second number if the rst number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder).
One Number as a Factor of AnotherA rst number is a factor of a second number if the rst number divides into the second number a whole number of times (without a remainder).


We show this in the following examples: Example 3.23
3 is a factor of 27, since 27  3 = 9, or 3  9 = 27. Example 3.24
7 is a factor of 56, since 56  7 = 8, or 7  8 = 56. Example 3.25
4 is not a factor of 10, since 10  4 = 2R2. (There is a remainder.)

PAGE	'3.4.4 Prime and Composite Numbers'
Notice that the only factors of 7 are 1 and 7 itself, and that the only factors of 3 are 1 and 3 itself. However, the number 8 has the factors 1, 2, 4, and 8, and the number 10 has the factors 1, 2, 5, and 10. Thus, we can see that a whole number can have only two factors (itself and 1) and another whole number can have several factors.
We can use this observation to make a useful classication for whole numbers: prime numbers and composite numbers.
Prime NumberA whole number (greater than one) whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number.
The Number 1 is Not a Prime NumberThe rst seven prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Notice that the whole number 1 is not considered to be a prime number, and the whole number 2 is the rst prime and the only even prime number.
Composite NumberA whole number composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a composite number. Composite numbers are not prime numbers.
Some composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15.
3.4.4.1 Sample Set BDetermine which whole numbers are prime and which are composite.
Example 3.27
39. Since 3 divides into 39, the number 39 is composite: 39  3 = 13

Prime numbers are very useful in the study of mathematics. We will see how they are used in subsequent sections. We now state the Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic.
Fundamental Principle of ArithmeticExcept for the order of the factors, every natural number other than 1 can be factored in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers.
Prime FactorizationWhen a number is factored so that all its factors are prime numbers. the factorization is called the prime factorization of the number.
The technique of prime factorization is illustrated in the following three examples.
1. 10 = 5  2. Both 2 and 5 are primes. Therefore, 2  5 is the prime factorization of 10.2. 11. The number 11 is a prime number. Prime factorization applies only to composite numbers. Thus,
11 has no prime factorization.3. 60=230. Thenumber30isnotprime: 30=215.
60 = 2  2  15Thenumber15isnotprime: 15=3560 = 2  2  3  5We'll use exponents.60=22 35The numbers 2, 3, and 5 are each prime. Therefore, 22  3  5 is the prime factorization of 60.
PAGE	'3.4.6 The Prime Factorization of a Natural Number'
The following method provides a way of nding the prime factorization of a natural number. The Method of Finding the Prime Factorization of a Natural Number
	1.	Divide the number repeatedly by the smallest prime number that will divide into it a whole number of times (without a remainder).
	2.	When the prime number used in step 1 no longer divides into the given number without a remainder, repeat the division process with the next largest prime that divides the given number.
	3.	Continue this process until the quotient is smaller than the divisor.
	4.	The prime factorization of the given number is the product of all these prime divisors. If the number has no prime divisors, it is a prime number.
We may be able to use some of the tests for divisibility we studied in Section 2.5 to help nd the primes that divide the given number.

# CHAPTER 3.
EXPONENTS, ROOTS, AND FACTORIZATION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Example 3.29
Find the prime factorization of 60.
Since the last digit of 60 is 0, which is even, 60 is divisible by 2. We will repeatedly divide by 2 until we no longer can. We shall divide as follows:
30 is divisible by 2 again.15 is not divisible by 2, but it is divisible by 3, the next prime. 5 is not divisble by 3, but it is divisible by 5, the next prime.
The quotient 1 is nally smaller than the divisor 5, and the prime factorization of 60 is the product of these prime divisors.
60 = 2  2  3  5We use exponents when possible.
60=22 35 Example 3.30
Find the prime factorization of 441.441 is not divisible by 2 since its last digit is not divisible by 2. 441 is divisible by 3 since 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 and 9 is divisible by 3.
147 is divisible by 3 (1 + 4 + 7 = 12) .49 is not divisible by 3, nor is it divisible by 5. It is divisible by 7.
The quotient 1 is nally smaller than the divisor 7, and the prime factorization of 441 is the product of these prime divisors.
441 = 3  3  7  7 Use exponents.
441=32 72 Example 3.31
Find the prime factorization of 31.

31 is not divisible by 2
31 is not divisible by 3
31 is not divisible by 5
31 is not divisible by 7.
Its last digit is not even312 = 15R1The quotient, 15, is larger than the divisor, 3. Continue. The digits 3 + 1 = 4, and 4 is not divisible by 3.313 = 10R1The quotient, 10, is larger than the divisor, 3. Continue. The last digit of 31 is not 0 or 5.315 = 6R1The quotient, 6, is larger than the divisor, 5. Continue. Divide by 7.317 = 4R1The quotient, 4, is smaller than the divisor, 7.We can stop the process and conclude that 31 is a prime number.

		The Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
		A Method for Determining the Greatest Common Factor 3.5.2 The Greatest Common Factor (GCF)Using the method we studied in Section 3.4, we could obtain the prime factorizations of 30 and 42. 30 = 2  3  5 42 = 2  3  7 Common FactorWe notice that 2 appears as a factor in both numbers, that is, 2 is a common factor of 30 and 42. We also notice that 3 appears as a factor in both numbers. Three is also a common factor of 30 and 42. 5
3.5 The Greatest Common Factor
PAGE	'3.5.1 Section Overview'


Greatest Common Factor (GCF)When considering two or more numbers, it is often useful to know if there is a largest common factor of the numbers, and if so, what that number is. The largest common factor of two or more whole numbers is called the greatest common factor, and is abbreviated by GCF. The greatest common factor of a collection of whole numbers is useful in working with fractions (which we will do in Section 4.1).
PAGE	'3.5.3 A Method for Determining the Greatest Common Factor'
A straightforward method for determining the GCF of two or more whole numbers makes use of both the prime factorization of the numbers and exponents.
Finding the GCFTo nd the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more whole numbers:
	1.	Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors.
	2.	Write each base that is common to each of the numbers.
	3.	To each base listed in step 2, attach the smallest exponent that appears on it in either of the prime factorizations.
	4.	The GCF is the product of the numbers found in step 3.
3.5.3.1 Sample Set AFind the GCF of the following numbers.
Example 3.32
12 and 18
12=26=223=22 3
1.18 = 2  9 = 2  3  3 = 2  32
	2.	The common bases are 2 and 3.
	3.	The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1 ( 21and 31), or 2 and 3.
	4.	The GCF is the product of these numbers. 2  3 = 6
The GCF of 30 and 42 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that divides both 30 and 42 without a remainder.
Example 3.33
18, 60, and 72
18 = 2  9 = 2  3  3 = 2  32
	1.	60=230=2215=2235=22 35 72=236=2218=2229=22233=23 32
	2.	The common bases are 2 and 3.
	3.	The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 1 and 1: 21 from 18 31 from 60

# CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS, ROOTS, AND FACTORIZATION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
Thus, 6 is the largest number that divides 18, 60, and 72 without a remainder.
Example 3.34
700, 1,880, and 6,160
1.
700 = 2350 = 22175
1,880 = 2940 = 22470
6,160 = 23,080 = 221,540
= 22535= 22557= 22 52 7= 222235= 222547= 23 547= 222770= 2222385 = 2222577 = 22225711 = 24 5711
	2.	The common bases are 2 and 5
	3.	The smallest exponents appearing on 2 and 5 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 1. 22 from 700. 51 from either 1,880 or 6,160.
	4.	The GCF is the product of these numbers. GCF is 22  5 = 4  5 = 20
Thus, 20 is the largest number that divides 700, 1,880, and 6,160 without a remainder.

Notice that in our number line visualization of common multiples (above), the rst common multiple is also the smallest, or least common multiple, abbreviated by LCM.
Least Common MultipleThe least common multiple, LCM, of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers will divide into without a remainder.
The least common multiple will be extremely useful in working with fractions (Section 4.1).
PAGE	'3.6.5 Finding the Least Common Multiple'
Finding the LCMTo nd the LCM of two or more numbers:
1. Write the prime factorization of each number, using exponents on repeated factors.2. Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations.3. To each base, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorizations. 4. The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3.
There are some major dierences between using the processes for obtaining the GCF and the LCM that we must note carefully:
The Dierence Between the Processes for Obtaining the GCF and the LCM
	1.	Notice the dierence between step 2 for the LCM and step 2 for the GCF. For the GCF, we use only the bases that are common in the prime factorizations, whereas for the LCM, we use each base that appears in the prime factorizations.
	2.	Notice the dierence between step 3 for the LCM and step 3 for the GCF. For the GCF, we attach the smallest exponents to the common bases, whereas for the LCM, we attach the largest exponents to the bases.
3.6.5.1 Sample Set CFind the LCM of the following numbers.
Example 3.36
9 and 12
9 = 3  3 = 32
1.12=26=223=22 3
	2.	The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2 and 3.
	3.	The largest exponents appearing on 2 and 3 in the prime factorizations are, respectively, 2 and 2: 22 from 12. 32 from 9.
	4.	The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 22  32 = 4  9 = 36
Thus, 36 is the smallest number that both 9 and 12 divide into without remainders.
Example 3.37
90 and 630
90 = 245=2315=2335=232 51. 630 = 2315=23105=23335 =23357
=232 57 2. The bases that appear in the prime factorizations are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
3. The largest exponents that appear on 2, 3, 5, and 7 are, respectively, 1, 2, 1, and 1:
21 from either 90 or 630. 32 from either 90 or 630. 51 from either 90 or 630. 71 from 630.
4. The LCM is the product of these numbers. LCM = 2  32  5  7 = 2  9  5  7 = 630
Thus, 630 is the smallest number that both 90 and 630 divide into with no remainders.

7 3.7 Summary of Key Concepts
PAGE	'3.7.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Exponential Notation (Section 3.2)Exponential notation is a description of repeated multiplication.
Exponent (Section 3.2)An exponent records the number of identical factors repeated in a multiplication.
In a number such as 73, Base (Section 3.2)
7 is called the base.
Exponent (Section 3.2)3 is called the exponent, or power.
Power (Section 3.2)73 is read "seven to the third power," or "seven cubed."
Squared, Cubed (Section 3.2)A number raised to the second power is often called squared. A number raised to the third power is often called cubed.
Root (Section 3.2)In mathematics, the word root is used to indicate that, through repeated multiplication, one number is the source of another number.
 


(Section 3.2)The symbol is called a radical sign and indicates the square root of a number. The symbol n
The Radical Sign

represents the nth root.
Radical, Index, Radicand (Section 3.2)
An expression such as radicand.

16 is called a radical and 4 is called the index. The number 16 is called the


Grouping Symbols (Section 3.3)Grouping symbols are used to indicate that a particular collection of numbers and meaningful operations are to be grouped together and considered as one number. The grouping symbols commonly used in mathematics are
Parentheses: ( ) Brackets: [ ] Braces: { } Bar:
Order of Operations (Section 3.3)
	1.	Perform all operations inside grouping symbols, beginning with the innermost set, in the order of 2, 3, and 4 below.
	2.	Perform all exponential and root operations, moving left to right.
	3.	Perform all multiplications and division, moving left to right.



# CHAPTER 3. EXPONENTS, ROOTS, AND FACTORIZATION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
4. Perform all additions and subtractions, moving left to right.
One Number as the Factor of Another (Section 3.4)A rst number is a factor of a second number if the rst number divides into the second number a whole number of times.
Prime Number (Section 3.4)A whole number greater than one whose only factors are itself and 1 is called a prime number. The whole number 1 is not a prime number. The whole number 2 is the rst prime number and the only even prime number.
Composite Number (Section 3.4)A whole number greater than one that is composed of factors other than itself and 1 is called a composite number.
Fundamental Principle of Arithmetic (Section 3.4)Except for the order of factors, every whole number other than 1 can be written in one and only one way as a product of prime numbers.
Prime Factorization (Section 3.4)The prime factorization of 45 is 3  3  5. The numbers that occur in this factorization of 45 are each prime.
Determining the Prime Factorization of a Whole Number (Section 3.4)There is a simple method, based on division by prime numbers, that produces the prime factorization of a whole number. For example, we determine the prime factorization of 132 as follows.
The prime factorization of 132 is 2  2  3  11 = 22  3  11.
Common Factor (Section 3.5)A factor that occurs in each number of a group of numbers is called a common factor. 3 is a common factor to the group 18, 6, and 45
Greatest Common Factor (GCF) (Section 3.5)The largest common factor of a group of whole numbers is called the greatest common factor. For example, to nd the greatest common factor of 12 and 20,
12 = 223=223
1. Write the prime factorization of each number.
60 = 2235=22 35
	2.	Write each base that is common to each of the numbers: 2 and 3
	3.	The smallest exponent appearing on 2 is 2. The smallest exponent appearing on 3 is 1.
	4.	The GCF of 12 and 60 is the product of the numbers 22 and 3. 22  3 = 4  3 = 12
Thus, 12 is the largest number that divides both 12 and 60 without a remainder.
Finding the GCF (Section 3.5)There is a simple method, based on prime factorization, that determines the GCF of a group of whole numbers.


Multiple (Section 3.6)When a whole number is multiplied by all other whole numbers, with the exception of zero, the resulting individual products are called multiples of that whole number. Some multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, and 28.
Common Multiples (Section 3.6)Multiples that are common to a group of whole numbers are called common multiples. Some common multiples of 6 and 9 are 18, 36, and 54.
The LCM (Section 3.6)The least common multiple (LCM) of a group of whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given whole numbers divides into without a remainder. The least common multiple of 9 and 6 is 18.
Finding the LCM (Section 3.6)There is a simple method, based on prime factorization, that determines the LCM of a group of whole numbers. For example, the least common multiple of 28 and 72 is found in the following way.
28 = 227=227
1. Write the prime factorization of each number
72 = 22233=23 32
	2.	Write each base that appears in each of the prime factorizations, 2, 3, and 7.
	3.	To each of the bases listed in step 2, attach the largest exponent that appears on it in the prime factorization. 23, 32, and 7
	4.	The LCM is the product of the numbers found in step 3. 23  32  7 = 8  9  7 = 504
Thus, 504 is the smallest number that both 28 and 72 will divide into without a remainder.
The Dierence Between the GCF and the LCM (Section 3.6)The GCF of two or more whole numbers is the largest number that divides into each of the given whole numbers. The LCM of two or more whole numbers is the smallest whole number that each of the given numbers divides into without a remainder.

# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS

PAGE	'4.2.2 More Numbers on the Number Line'
In Chapters Section 1.1, Section 2.1, and Section 3.1, we studied the whole numbers and methods of combining them. We noted that we could visually display the whole numbers by drawing a number line and placing closed circles at whole number locations.
By observing this number line, we can see that the whole numbers do not account for every point on the line. What numbers, if any, can be associated with these points? In this section we will see that many of the points on the number line, including the points already associated with whole numbers, can be associated with numbers called fractions.
PAGE	'4.2.3 Fractions of Whole Numbers'
The Nature of the Positive FractionsWe can extend our collection of numbers, which now contains only the whole numbers, by including fractions of whole numbers. We can determine the nature of these fractions using the number line.
If we place a pencil at some whole number and proceed to travel to the right to the next whole number, we see that our journey can be broken into dierent types of equal parts as shown in the following examples.
a. 1 part.
b. 2 equal parts.
c. 3 equal parts.

d. 4 equal parts.
The Latin Word FractioNotice that the number of parts, 2, 3, and 4, that we are breaking the original quantity into is always a nonzero whole number. The idea of breaking up a whole quantity gives us the word fraction. The word fraction comes from the Latin word "fractio" which means a breaking, or fracture.
Suppose we break up the interval from some whole number to the next whole number into ve equal parts.
After starting to move from one whole number to the next, we decide to stop after covering only two parts. We have covered 2 parts of 5 equal parts. This situation is described by writing 2 .

	1.	The fraction bar .Fraction BarThe fraction bar serves as a grouping symbol. It separates a quantity into individual groups. These groups have names, as noted in 2 and 3 below.
	2.	The nonzero number below the fraction bar.Denominator This number is called the denominator of the fraction, and it indicates the number of parts the whole quantity has been divided into. Notice that the denominator must be a nonzero whole number since the least number of parts any quantity can have is one.
	3.	The number above the fraction bar. NumeratorThis number is called the numerator of the fraction, and it indicates how many of the specied parts are being considered. Notice that the numerator can be any whole number (including zero) since any number of the specied parts can be considered. whole number  numerator nonzero whole number denominator
4.2.4.1 Sample Set AThe diagrams in the following problems are illustrations of fractions.

PAGE	'4.2.5 Reading and Writing Fractions'
In order to properly translate fractions from word form to number form, or from number form to word form, it is necessary to understand the use of the hyphen.
Use of the HyphenOne of the main uses of the hyphen is to tell the reader that two words not ordinarily joined are to be taken in combination as a unit. Hyphens are always used for numbers between and including 21 and 99 (except those ending in zero).
4.2.5.1 Sample Set BWrite each fraction using whole numbers.
Example 4.5
Fifty three-hundredths. The hyphen joins the words three and hundredths and tells us to
consider them as a single unit. Therefore,

Now that we know what positive fractions are, we consider three types of positive fractions: proper fractions, improper fractions, and mixed numbers.
PAGE	'4.3.2 Positive Proper Fractions'
Positive Proper FractionFractions in which the whole number in the numerator is strictly less than the whole number in the de- nominator are called positive proper fractions. On the number line, proper fractions are located in the interval from 0 to 1. Positive proper fractions are always less than one.



# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS

The closed circle at 0 indicates that 0 is included, while the open circle at 1 indicates that 1 is not included. Some examples of positive proper fractions are
1, 3, 20, and 106 2 5 27 255
Notethat1 < 2,3 < 5,20 < 27,and106 < 225. 4.3.3 Positive Improper Fractions
Positive Improper FractionsFractions in which the whole number in the numerator is greater than or equal to the whole number in the denominator are called positive improper fractions. On the number line, improper fractions lie to the right of (and including) 1. Positive improper fractions are always greater than or equal to 1.

Some examples of positive improper fractions are 3 , 8 , 4 , and 105

254 16Note that 3  2, 8  5, 4  4, and 105  16.
PAGE	'4.3.4 Positive Mixed Numbers'
Positive Mixed Numbers A number of the form
nonzero whole number + proper fractionis called a positive mixed number. For example, 23 is a mixed number. On the number line, mixed

numbers are located in the interval to the right of (and including) 1. Mixed numbers are always greater than or equal to 1.
PAGE	'4.3.5 Relating Positive Improper Fractions and Positive Mixed Numbers'
A relationship between improper fractions and mixed numbers is suggested by two facts. The rst is that improper fractions and mixed numbers are located in the same interval on the number line. The second fact, that mixed numbers are the sum of a natural number and a fraction, can be seen by making the following observations.
Divide a whole quantity into 3 equal parts.

Now, consider the following examples by observing the respective shaded areas.
In the shaded region, there are 2 one thirds, or 2 . 3
21= 2 33
There are 3 one thirds, or 3 , or 1. 3
31=3 or1 33
Thus,
3=1 3
Improper fraction = whole number.
There are 4 one thirds, or 4, or 1 and 1. 33
41=4or1 and 1 333
The terms 1 and 1 can be represented as 1+ 1 or 11 333
Thus,4 =11.

Improper fraction = mixed number.
There are 5 one thirds, or 5, or 1 and 2. 33
51=5 or 1 and 2 333
The terms 1 and 2 can be represented as 1+ 2 or 12. 333
Thus,5 =12.

Improper fraction = mixed number.
There are 6 one thirds, or 6 , or 2. 3
61=6 =2 33



Thus,
6=2 3
# CHAPTER 4.
INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS

Improper fraction = whole number.The following important fact is illustrated in the preceding examples.
Mixed Number = Natural Number + Proper FractionMixed numbers are the sum of a natural number and a proper fraction. Mixed number = (natural number) + (proper fraction)
For example 11 can be expressed as 1+ 1 The fraction 57 can be expressed as 5+ 7. 3388
It is important to note that a number such as 5 + 7 does not indicate multiplication. To indicate multipli- 8
cation, we would need to use a multiplication symbol (such as )note: 57 means 5+ 7 and not 5 7, which means 5 times 7 or 5 multiplied by 7.
Thus, mixed numbers may be represented by improper fractions, and improper fractions may be represented by mixed numbers.
PAGE	'4.3.6 Converting Improper Fractions to Mixed NumbersTo understand how we might convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, let's consider the fraction, 4 .'



4 = 1+1+1+1 3 3333
  

= 1+1 3
= 11 3
Thus, 4 =11. 33


We can illustrate a procedure for converting an improper fraction to a mixed number using this example. However, the conversion is more easily accomplished by dividing the numerator by the denominator and using the result to write the mixed number.
Converting an Improper Fraction to a Mixed NumberTo convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, divide the numerator by the denominator.
1. The whole number part of the mixed number is the quotient.2. The fractional part of the mixed number is the remainder written over the divisor (the denominator
of the improper fraction).

The procedure for converting a mixed number to an improper fraction is illustrated in this example.
Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction,
1. Multiply the denominator of the fractional part of the mixed number by the whole number part. 2. To this product, add the numerator of the fractional part.3. Place this result over the denominator of the fractional part.

		Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms
		Raising Fractions to Higher Terms 4.4.2 Equivalent FractionsLet's examine the following two diagrams.


Notice that both 2 and 4 represent the same part of the whole, that is, they represent the same number. 36
Equivalent FractionsFractions that have the same value are called equivalent fractions. Equivalent fractions may look dierent, but they are still the same point on the number line.
There is an interesting property that equivalent fractions satisfy.
A Test for Equivalent Fractions Using the Cross Product These pairs of products are called cross products.



# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS
If the cross products are equal, the fractions are equivalent. If the cross products are not equal, the fractions are not equivalent.

It is often very useful to convert one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the
numerator and denominator. We can suggest a method for doing so by considering the equivalent fractions
9 and 3. First, divide both the numerator and denominator of 9 by 3. The fractions 9 and 3 are 15 5 15 15 5
equivalent.

(Can you prove this?) So, 9 = 3 . We wish to convert 9 to 3 . Now divide the numerator and denominator
15 5 of 9 by 3, and see what happens.

93 =3 153 5
The fraction 9 is converted to 3 . 15 5
15 5


A natural question is "Why did we choose to divide by 3?" Notice that
9 =33 15 53
We can see that the factor 3 is common to both the numerator and denominator.
Reducing a FractionFrom these observations we can suggest the following method for converting one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has reduced values in the numerator and denominator. The method is called reducing a fraction.
A fraction can be reduced by dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero whole number.
Consider the collection of equivalent fractions 5,4,3,2,1
20 16 12 8 4Reduced to Lowest Terms
Notice that each of the rst four fractions can be reduced to the last fraction, 1, by dividing both the 4
numerator and denominator by, respectively, 5, 4, 3, and 2. When a fraction is converted to the fraction
that has the smallest numerator and denominator in its collection of equivalent fractions, it is said to be
reduced to lowest terms. The fractions 1 , 3 , 2 , and 7 are all reduced to lowest terms. 485 10
Observe a very important property of a fraction that has been reduced to lowest terms. The only whole number that divides both the numerator and denominator without a remainder is the number 1. When 1 is the only whole number that divides two whole numbers, the two whole numbers are said to be relatively prime.
Relatively PrimeA fraction is reduced to lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are relatively prime.
4.4.3.1 Methods of Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms Method 1: Dividing Out Common Primes
	1.	Write the numerator and denominator as a product of primes.
	2.	Divide the numerator and denominator by each of the common prime factors. We often indicate this division by drawing a slanted line through each divided out factor. This process is also called cancelling common factors.
	3.	The product of the remaining factors in the numerator and the product of remaining factors of the denominator are relatively prime, and this fraction is reduced to lowest terms.

# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS
PAGE	'4.4.4 Raising Fractions to Higher Terms'
Equally as important as reducing fractions is raising fractions to higher terms. Raising a fraction to higher terms is the process of constructing an equivalent fraction that has higher values in the numerator and denominator than the original fraction.
The fractions 3 and 9 are equivalent, that is, 3 = 9 . Notice also, 5 15 5 15
33 = 9 53 15
Notice that 3 = 1 and that 3  1 = 3 . We are not changing the value of 3 . 3555
From these observations we can suggest the following method for converting one fraction to an equivalent fraction that has higher values in the numerator and denominator. This method is called raising a fraction to higher terms.
Raising a Fraction to Higher TermsA fraction can be raised to an equivalent fraction that has higher terms in the numerator and denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same nonzero whole number.
The fraction 3 can be raised to 24 by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 8. 4 32
Most often, we will want to convert a given fraction to an equivalent fraction with a higher specied de- nominator. For example, we may wish to convert 5 to an equivalent fraction that has denominator 32, that

is,
5=? 8 32


This is possible to do because we know the process. We must multiply both the numerator and denominator of 5 by the same nonzero whole number in order to 8 obtain an equivalent fraction.

We have some information. The denominator 8 was raised to 32 by multiplying it by some nonzero whole number. Division will give us the proper factor. Divide the original denominator into the new denominator.
32  8 = 4
Now, multiply the numerator 5 by 4.
5  4 = 20
Thus,5 =54 =20

5 = 20 8 32

4.5 Multiplication of Fractions
PAGE	'4.5.1 Section Overview'

We know that a fraction represents a part of a whole quantity. For example, two fths of one unit can be represented by
2 of the whole is shaded. 5
A natural question is, what is a fractional part of a fractional quantity, or, what is a fraction of a fraction? For example, what 2 of 1 ?

We can suggest an answer to this question by using a picture to examine 2 of 1 . 32
First, let's represent 1 . 2
1 of the whole is shaded. 2
Then divide each of the 1 parts into 3 equal parts. 2


Each part is 1 of the whole. 6
Now we'll take 2 of the 1 unit. 32
2 of1 is2,whichreducesto1. 326 3
PAGE	'4.5.3 Multiplication of FractionsNow we ask, what arithmetic operation (+, , , ) will produce 2 from 2 of 1 ?'


632Notice that, if in the fractions 2 and 1 , we multiply the numerators together and the denominators together,

we get precisely 2 . 6
21 = 2 32 6
This reduces to 1 as before. 3


Using this observation, we can suggest the following:
1. The word "of" translates to the arithmetic operation "times."2. To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators together and then multiply the denomina-
tors together. Reduce if necessary.
numerator 1  numerator 2 = numerator 1  numerator 2 denominator 1 denominator 2 denominator 1 denominator 2
4.5.3.1 Sample Set APerform the following multiplications.
Example 4.31
3  1 = 31 = 3 Now, reduce.

= )3 = 1 )24 8

Thus
31=1 468
Thismeansthat 3 of 1 is 1,thatis, 3 of 1 ofaunitis 1 oftheoriginalunit. 468468

PAGE	'4.5.4 Multiplying Fractions by Dividing Out Common Factors'
We have seen that to multiply two fractions together, we multiply numerators together, then denominators together, then reduce to lowest terms, if necessary. The reduction can be tedious if the numbers in the fractions are large. For example,
9 10=910 =90 =45 =15 16 21 1621 336 168 28
We avoid the process of reducing if we divide out common factors before we multiply.


9  10 = )9  )10 = 35 = 15 16 21 )16 )21 87 56



Divide 3 into 9 and 21, and divide 2 into 10 and 16. The product is a fraction that is reduced to lowest terms.
The Process of Multiplication by Dividing Out Common FactorsTo multiply fractions by dividing out common factors, divide out factors that are common to both a numer- ator and a denominator. The factor being divided out can appear in any numerator and any denominator.

Our concept of division is that it indicates how many times one quantity is contained in another quantity. For example, using the diagram we can see that there are 6 one-thirds in 2.
There are 6 one-thirds in 2. Since 2 contains six 1 's we express this as


Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing a number by a fraction.
Dividing One Fraction by Another FractionTo divide a rst fraction by a second, nonzero fraction, multiply the rst traction by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS
PAGE	'4.7.2 Multiplication Statements'
Statement, Multiplication StatementA statement is a sentence that is either true or false. A mathematical statement of the form
product = (factor 1)  (factor 2)
is a multiplication statement. Depending on the numbers that are used, it can be either true or false.
Omitting exactly one of the three numbers in the statement will produce exactly one of the following three problems. For convenience, we'll represent the omitted (or missing) number with the letter M (M for Missing).
1. M = (factor 1)  (factor 2) Missing product statement. 2. M  (factor 2) = product Missing factor statement.3. (factor 1)  M = product Missing factor statement.
We are interested in developing and working with methods to determine the missing number that makes the statement true. Fundamental to these methods is the ability to translate two words to mathematical symbols. The word
of translates to times is translates to equals
PAGE	'4.7.3 Missing Products Statements'
The equation M = 8  4 is a missing product statement. We can nd the value of M that makes this statement true by multiplying the known factors.
Missing product statements can be used to determine the answer to a question such as, "What number is fraction 1 of fraction 2?
4.7.3.1 Sample Set AFind 3 of 8 . We are being asked the question, "What number is 3 of 8 ?" We must translate from words to
mathematical symbols.

M=)3 )8 =12 =2 )4 )9 13 3

Thus,3 of8 is2. 493

M= 3 )24 =36 =18 =18 )4 1 11 1

Thus, 18 is 3 of 24. 4

PAGE	'4.7.4 Missing Factor StatementsThe equation 8  M = 32 is a missing factor statement. We can nd the value of M that makes this'
statement true by dividing (since we know that 32  8 = 4).
Finding the Missing FactorTo nd the missing factor in a missing factor statement, divide the product by the known factor. missing factor = (product)  (known factor)
Missing factor statements can be used to answer such questions as 1. 3 of what number is 9?

84 2. What part of 12 is 113?

Thus,3 of6is9. 84

For convenience, let's convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions. M  9 = 27

# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS

Fraction (Section 4.2)The idea of breaking up a whole quantity into equal parts gives us the word fraction.
Fraction Bar, Denominator, Numerator (Section 4.2) A fraction has three parts:
1. The fraction bar2. The nonzero whole number below the fraction bar is the denominator. 3. The whole number above the fraction bar is the numerator.
Proper Fraction (Section 4.3)Proper fractions are fractions in which the numerator is strictly less than the denominator.
4 is a proper fraction 5
Improper Fraction (Section 4.3)Improper fractions are fractions in which the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
Also, any nonzero number placed over 1 is an improper fraction. 5 , 5 , and 5 are improper fractions

Mixed Number (Section 4.3)A mixed number is a number that is the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction.
11 isamixednumber11 =1+1 555
Correspondence Between Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers (Section 4.3)Each improper fraction corresponds to a particular mixed number, and each mixed number corresponds to
a particular improper fraction.
Converting an Improper Fraction to a Mixed Number (Section 4.3)A method, based on division, converts an improper fraction to an equivalent mixed number.
5 can be converted to 11 44
Converting a Mixed Number to an Improper Fraction (Section 4.3)A method, based on multiplication, converts a mixed number to an equivalent improper fraction.
57 can be converted to 47 88
Equivalent Fractions (Section 4.4)Fractions that represent the same quantity are equivalent fractions.
3 and 6 are equivalent fractions 48


4.8 Summary of Key Concepts
PAGE	'4.8.1 Summary of Key Concepts'

Test for Equivalent Fractions (Section 4.4)If the cross products of two fractions are equal, then the two fractions are equivalent.
Thus, 3 and 6 are equivalent. 48
Relatively Prime (Section 4.4)Two whole numbers are relatively prime when 1 is the only number that divides both of them.
3 and 4 are relatively prime
Reduced to Lowest Terms (Section 4.4)A fraction is reduced to lowest terms if its numerator and denominator are relatively prime.
The number 3 is reduced to lowest terms, since 3 and 4 are relatively prime. 4
The number 6 is not reduced to lowest terms since 6 and 8 are not relatively prime. 8


Reducing Fractions to Lowest Terms (Section 4.4)Two methods, one based on dividing out common primes and one based on dividing out any common factors,
are available for reducing a fraction to lowest terms.
Raising Fractions to Higher Terms (Section 4.4)A fraction can be raised to higher terms by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the same
nonzero number.
3 =32 =6 4 42 8
The Word OF Means Multiplication (Section 4.5)In many mathematical applications, the word "of" means multiplication.
Multiplication of Fractions (Section 4.5)To multiply two or more fractions, multiply the numerators together and multiply the denominators together.
Reduce if possible. 54 =54 =20 =1
8 15 815 120 6
Multiplying Fractions by Dividing Out Common Factors (Section 4.5)Two or more fractions can be multiplied by rst dividing out common factors and then using the rule for
multiplying fractions.

)5)4 =11=1 )8 )15 23 6

Multiplication of Mixed Numbers (Section 4.5)To perform a multiplication in which there are mixed numbers, rst convert each mixed number to an
improper fraction, then multiply. This idea also applies to division of mixed numbers.
Reciprocals (Section 4.6)Two numbers whose product is 1 are reciprocals.
7 and 1 are reciprocals 7


# CHAPTER 4. INTRODUCTION TO FRACTIONS AND MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION OF FRACTIONS
Division of Fractions (Section 4.6)To divide one fraction by another fraction, multiply the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor.
4  2 = 4  15 5 15 5 2
Dividing 1 by a Fraction (Section 4.6)When dividing 1 by a fraction, the quotient is the reciprocal of the fraction.
1=7 33

Multiplication Statements (Section 4.7) A mathematical statement of the form
product = (factor 1) (factor 2)is a multiplication statement.By omitting one of the three numbers, one of three following problems result:
1. M = (factor 1)  (factor 2) Missing product statement. 2. product = (factor 1)  M Missing factor statement.3. product = M  (factor 2) Missing factor statement.
Missing products are determined by simply multiplying the known factors. Missing factors are determined by

missing factor = (product)  (known factor)

PAGE	'5.2.1 Section Overview'
		Addition of Fraction With Like Denominators
		Subtraction of Fractions With Like Denominators 5.2.2 Addition of Fraction With Like Denominators Let's examine the following diagram. 2 one-fths and 1 one fth is shaded. It is shown in the shaded regions of the diagram that (2 one-fths) + (1 one-fth) = (3 one-fths) That is, 2+1=3 555 From this observation, we can suggest the following rule.

Method of Adding Fractions Having Like DenominatorsTo add two or more fractions that have the same denominators, add the numerators and place the resulting sum over the common denominator. Reduce, if necessary.
5.2.2.1 Sample Set A Find the following sums.
Example 5.1
3 + 2 . The denominators are the same. Add the numerators and place that sum over 7.

3 + 2 = 3+2 = 5 7777
Example 5.2
1 + 3 . The denominators are the same. Add the numerators and place the sum over 8. Reduce.

1 + 3 = 1+3 = 4 = 1 88882
Example 5.3
4 + 5 . The denominators are the same. Add the numerators and place the sum over 9.

4 + 5 = 4+5 = 9 = 1 9999
Example 5.4
7 + 5 . The denominators are the same. Add the numerators and place the sum over 8.

7 + 5 = 7+5 = 12 = 3 88882


Example 5.5
To see what happens if we mistakenly add the denominators as well as the numerators, let's add
1+1 22
Adding the numerators and mistakenly adding the denominators produces
1 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 = 1 2 2 2+2 4 2
This means that two 1 's is the same as one 1 . Preposterous! We do not add denominators. 22

From this observation, we can suggest the following rule for subtracting fractions having like denominators:
Subtraction of Fractions with Like DenominatorsTo subtract two fractions that have like denominators, subtract the numerators and place the resulting dierence over the common denominator. Reduce, if possible.
5.2.3.1 Sample Set BFind the following dierences.

Example 5.8
16  2 . The denominators are the same. Subtract numerators and place the dierence over 9.

16 2 =162 =14 9999
Example 5.9
To see what happens if we mistakenly subtract the denominators, let's consider
7  4 = 74 = 3 15 15 1515 0
We get division by zero, which is undened. We do not subtract denominators.

5.3 Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Unlike Denominators
PAGE	'5.3.1 Section Overview'
		A Basic Rule
		Addition and Subtraction of Fractions 3


PAGE	'5.3.2 A Basic RuleThere is a basic rule that must be followed when adding or subtracting fractions.'
A Basic RuleFractions can only be added or subtracted conveniently if they have like denominators.
To see why this rule makes sense, let's consider the problem of adding a quarter and a dime. 1 quarter + 1 dime = 35 centsNow,
1 quarter = 25 100 }
1 dime= 10 100
35, = 35 100
same denominations


25 + 10 = 25+10 = 35 100 100 100 100

In order to combine a quarter and a dime to produce 35, we convert them to quantities of the same denomination.
Same denomination  same denominator5.3.3 Addition and Subtraction of Fractions
Least Common Multiple (LCM) and Least Common Denominator (LCD)In Section 3.6, we examined the least common multiple (LCM) of a collection of numbers. If these numbers are used as denominators of fractions, we call the least common multiple, the least common denominator (LCD).
Method of Adding or Subtracting Fractions with Unlike DenominatorsTo add or subtract fractions having unlike denominators, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction having as a denominator the least common denominator ( LCD) of the original denominators.
5.3.3.1 Sample Set AFind the following sums and dierences.
Example 5.10
1 + 3 . The denominators are not the same. Find the LCD of 6 and 4.

6 = 2 3}The LCD = 22  3 = 4  3 = 12 4 = 22
Write each of the original fractions as a new, equivalent fraction having the common denominator 12.
1+3= +6 4 12 12
To nd a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this quotient.


12  6 = 2
12  4 = 3

1+2=+ 2366
To nd a new numerator, we divide the original denominator into the LCD. Since the original denominator is being multiplied by this quotient, we must multiply the original numerator by this quotient.
6  2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 1 by 3. 6  2 = 3 Multiply the numerator 2 by 2.

Our number system is called an ordered number system because the numbers in the system can be placed in order from smaller to larger. This is easily seen on the number line.
On the number line, a number that appears to the right of another number is larger than that other number. For example, 5 is greater than 2 because 5 is located to the right of 2 on the number line. We may also say that 2 is less than 5.
To make the inequality phrases "greater than" and "less than" more brief, mathematicians represent them with the symbols > and <, respectively.
Symbols for Greater Than > and Less Than < > represents the phrase "greater than."< represents the phrase "less than."
5 > 2 represents "5 is greater than 2."
2 < 5 represents "2 is less than 5."



PAGE	'5.5.3 Comparing FractionsRecall that the fraction 4 indicates that we have 4 of 5 parts of some whole quantity, and the fraction 3'


indicates that we have 3 of 5 parts. Since 4 of 5 parts is more than 3 of 5 parts, 4 is greater than 3 ; that is, 55

4>3 55
We have just observed that when two fractions have the same denominator, we can determine which is larger by comparing the numerators.
Comparing FractionsIf two fractions have the same denominators, the fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction.
Thus, to compare the sizes of two or more fractions, we need only convert each of them to equivalent fractions that have a common denominator. We then compare the numerators. It is convenient if the common denominator is the LCD. The fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction.
5.5.3.1 Sample Set A Example 5.16
Compare 8 and 14. 9 15
Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as the denominator. Find the LCD.
9 45 45 14 =143 =42
15 45 45
Since 40 < 42, 40 < 42
45 45
Thus 8 < 14. 9 15

9 = 32 15 = 35
} The LCD = 32  5 = 9  5 = 45 8 =85 =40

Example 5.17

Writing these numbers in order from smallest to largest, we get 7 , 5 , 13 . 10 6 15
Example 5.18
Compare 86 and 63.
To compare mixed numbers that have dierent whole number parts, we need only compare whole number parts. Since 6 < 8,

PAGE	'5.6.3 Converting Complex Fractions to Simple Fractions'
The goal here is to convert a complex fraction to a simple fraction. We can do so by employing the methods of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions. Recall from Section 4.2 that a fraction bar serves as a grouping symbol separating the fractional quantity into two individual groups. We proceed in simplifying a complex fraction to a simple fraction by simplifying the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction separately. We will simplify the numerator and denominator completely before removing the fraction bar by dividing. This technique is illustrated in problems 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Section 5.6.3.1 (Sample Set A).

Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Like Denominators (Section 5.2)To add or subtract two fractions that have the same denominators, add or subtract the numerators and place the resulting sum or dierence over the common denominator. Reduce, if necessary. Do not add or subtract the denominators.
1 + 5 = 1+5 = 6 = 3 88884
Basic Rule for Adding and Subtracting Fractions (Section 5.3)Fractions can be added or subtracted conveniently only if they have like denominators.
Addition and Subtraction of Fractions with Unlike Denominators (Section 5.3)To add or subtract fractions having unlike denominators, convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction having as denominator the LCD of the original denominators.
Addition and Subtraction of Mixed Numbers (Section 5.4)1. To add or subtract mixed numbers, convert each mixed number to an improper fraction, then add or subtract the fractions.
Ordered Number System (Section 5.5)Our number system is ordered because the numbers in the system can be placed in order from smaller to larger.
Inequality Symbols (Section 5.5) > represents the phrase "greater than." < represents the phrase "less than."
Comparing Fractions (Section 5.5)If two fractions have the same denominators, the fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction.
5>3 88
Simple Fractions (Section 5.6)A simple fraction is any fraction in which the numerator is any whole number and the denominator is any nonzero whole number.
Complex Fractions (Section 5.6)A complex fraction is any fraction in which the numerator and/or the denominator is a fraction.
Complex fractions can be converted to simple fractions by employing the methods of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions.

PAGE	'6.2.2 Digits to the Right of the Ones Position'
6.2 Reading and Writing Decimals
PAGE	'6.2.1 Section Overview'
		Digits to the Right of the Ones Position
		Decimal Fractions
		Reading Decimal Fractions
		Writing Decimal Fractions
We began our study of arithmetic (Section 1.2) by noting that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten. We also noted that each position has a particular value. We observed that each position has ten times the value of the position to its right.
This means that each position has 1 the value of the position to its left. 10
Thus, a digit written to the right of the units position must have a value of 1 of 1. Recalling that the word 10
"of" translates to multiplication (), we can see that the value of the rst position to the right of the units digit is 1 of 1, or

11=1 10 10
The value of the second position to the right of the units digit is 1 of 1 , or 10 10
11=1=1 10 10 102 100


The value of the third position to the right of the units digit is 1 of 1 , or 10 100
11=1=1 10 100 103 1000
This pattern continues.


We can now see that if we were to write digits in positions to the right of the units positions, those positions have values that are fractions. Not only do the positions have fractional values, but the fractional values are all powers of 10 10,102,103,....
PAGE	'6.2.3 Decimal Fractions'
Decimal Point, DecimalIf we are to write numbers with digits appearing to the right of the units digit, we must have a way of denoting where the whole number part ends and the fractional part begins. Mathematicians denote the separation point of the units digit and the tenths digit by writing a decimal point. The word decimal comes from the Latin prex "deci" which means ten, and we use it because we use a base ten number system. Numbers written in this form are called decimal fractions, or more simply, decimals.
Notice that decimal numbers have the sux "th."
Decimal FractionA decimal fraction is a fraction in which the denominator is a power of 10.
The following numbers are examples of decimals.
	1.	42.6The 6 is in the tenths position. 42.6 = 42 6 10
	2.	9.8014The 8 is in the tenths position.The 0 is in the hundredths position.The 1 is in the thousandths position. The 4 is in the ten thousandths position. 9.8014 = 9 8014 10,000
	3.	0.93The 9 is in the tenths position.The 3 is in the hundredths position. 0.93 = 93 100 note: Quite often a zero is inserted in front of a decimal point (in the units position) of a decimal fraction that has a value less than one. This zero helps keep us from overlooking the decimal point.

# CHAPTER 6. DECIMALS
4. 0.7The 7 is in the tenths position.
0.7= 7 10
note: We can insert zeros to the right of the right-most digit in a decimal fraction without changing the value of the number.
7 =0.7=0.70= 70 = 7 10 100 10
PAGE	'6.2.4 Reading Decimal Fractions'
Reading a Decimal Fraction To read a decimal fraction,
1. Read the whole number part as usual. (If the whole number is less than 1, omit steps 1 and 2.) 2. Read the decimal point as the word "and."3. Read the number to the right of the decimal point as if it were a whole number.4. Say the name of the position of the last digit.
6.2.4.1 Sample Set A Read the following numbers.
Example 6.1
6.8
note: Some people read this as "six point eight." This phrasing gets the message across, but technically, "six and eight tenths" is the correct phrasing.
Example 6.2

Example 6.3
0.0019
Example 6.4

PAGE	'6.4.2 Rounding Decimal Numbers'
We rst considered the concept of rounding numbers in Section 1.4 where our concern with rounding was related to whole numbers only. With a few minor changes, we can apply the same rules of rounding to decimals.
To round a decimal to a particular position:
1. Mark the position of the round-o digit (with an arrow or check).2. Note whether the digit to the immediate right of the marked digit is
(a) less than 5. If so, leave the round-o digit unchanged. (b) 5 or greater. If so, add 1 to the round-o digit.
3. If the round-o digit is
(a) to the right of the decimal point, eliminate all the digits to its right.(b) to the left of the decimal point, replace all the digits between it and the decimal point with zeros
and eliminate the decimal point and all the decimal digits.
6.4.2.1 Sample Set A
Round each decimal to the specied position. (The numbers in parentheses indicate which step is being used.)
Example 6.15

PAGE	'6.4.1 Section Overview'
 Rounding Decimal Numbers


(2b) The digit immediately to the right is 6, and 6 > 5, so we add 1 to the round-o digit: 1+1=2
(3a) The round-o digit is to the right of the decimal point, so we eliminate all digits to its right. 32.12
The number 32.116 rounded to the nearest hundredth is 32.12.
Example 6.16
Round 633.14216 to the nearest hundred.
(1)(2a) The digit immediately to the right is 3, and 3 < 5 so we leave the round-o digit unchanged. (3b) The round-o digit is to the left of 0, so we replace all the digits between it and the decimal
point with zeros and eliminate the decimal point and all the decimal digits. 600
The number 633.14216 rounded to the nearest hundred is 600.
Example 6.17
1,729.63 rounded to the nearest ten is 1,730.
Example 6.18
1.0144 rounded to the nearest tenth is 1.0.
Example 6.19
60.98 rounded to the nearest one is 61.
Sometimes we hear a phrase such as "round to three decimal places." This phrase means that the round-o digit is the third decimal digit (the digit in the thousandths position).
Example 6.20
67.129 rounded to the second decimal place is 67.13.

Thus, 4.37 + 3.22 = 7.59.6.5.3 The Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals
When writing the previous addition, we could have written the numbers in columns.
4.37 +3.22 7.59


= 4100+37 + 3100+22 100 100
= 437 + 322 100 100

=
=
437+322 100
759 100

= 7 59
100= seven and fty-nine hundredths
= 7.59

This agrees with our previous result. From this observation, we can suggest a method for adding and subtracting decimal numbers.
Method of Adding and Subtracting Decimals To add or subtract decimals:
	1.	Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column.
	2.	Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
	3.	Place a decimal point in the resulting sum or dierence directly under the other decimal points.
6.5.3.1 Sample Set AFind the following sums and dierences.
Example 6.22
9.813 + 2.140
9.813 The decimal points are aligned in the same column. +2.140
11.953 Example 6.23
841.0056 + 47.016 + 19.058


# CHAPTER 6. DECIMALS
841.0056 47.016 +19.058

To insure that the columns align properly, we can write a 0 in the position at the end of the numbers 47.016 and 19.058 without changing their values.
Example 6.24!!!
1.314  0.58 1.314
0.58 Write a 0 in the thousandths position.
Example 6.25!!!
16.01  7.053 16.01
7.053 Write a 0 in the thousandths position.
Example 6.26
Find the sum of 6.88106 and 3.5219 and round it to three decimal places.
6.88106+3.5219 Write a 0 in the ten thousandths position.
We need to round the sum to the thousandths position. Since the digit in the position immediately to the right is 9, and 9>5, we get
10.403
Example 6.27
Wendy has $643.12 in her checking account. She writes a check for $16.92. How much is her new
account balance?

To nd the new account balance, we need to nd the dierence between 643.12 and 16.92. We will subtract 16.92 from 643.12.
After writing a check for $16.92, Wendy now has a balance of $626.20 in her checking account.

PAGE	'6.5.4 Calculators'
The calculator can be useful for nding sums and dierences of decimal numbers. However, calculators with an eight-digit display cannot be used when working with decimal numbers that contain more than eight digits, or when the sum results in more than eight digits. In practice, an eight-place decimal will seldom be encountered. There are some inexpensive calculators that can handle 13 decimal places.

Since we expect 4 + 5 = 9 decimal places in the product, we know that an eight-digit display calculator will not be able to provide us with the exact value. To obtain the exact value, we must use "hand technology." Suppose, however, that we agree to round o this product to three decimal places. We then need only four decimal places on the display.

We have, up to this point, divided 196.8 by 6 and have gotten a quotient of 32 with a remainder of 4. If we follow our intuition and bring down the .8, we have the division 4.8  6.
4.86 = 48 6 10
= 486 10 1

= )481



Thus, 4.8  6 = .8.Now, our intuition and experience with division direct us to place the .8 immediately to the right of 32.
From these observations, we suggest the following method of division.

Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Nonzero Whole Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero whole number:
	1.	Write a decimal point above the division line and directly over the decimal point of the dividend.
	2.	Proceed to divide as if both numbers were whole numbers.
	3.	If, in the quotient, the rst nonzero digit occurs to the right of the decimal point, but not in the tenths position, place a zero in each position between the decimal point and the rst nonzero digit of the quotient.
6.7.3.1 Sample Set AFind the decimal representations of the following quotients.
Example 6.44!!!
114.1  7 = 7
16.3 7)114.1
7 44 42
2.1 2.1 0
Thus, 114.1  7 = 16.3.Check: If 114.1  7 = 16.3, then 7  16.3 should equal 114.1.

16.3 7
114.1 True. Example 6.45

PAGE	'6.7.4 A Method of Dividing a Decimal By a Nonzero Decimal'
Now that we can divide decimals by nonzero whole numbers, we are in a position to divide decimals by a nonzero decimal. We will do so by converting a division by a decimal into a division by a whole number, a process with which we are already familiar. We'll illustrate the method using this example: Divide 4.32 by 1.8.
Let's look at this problem as 4 32 100
1 8 . 10


4 32 43218 = 100
100 10 18 10 432 100

=
18 10
. We

The divisor is
18 10

can convert
18 10
into a whole number if we multiply it by 10.

18  10 = 18  )10 = 18 10 )101


But, we know from our experience with fractions, that if we multiply the denominator of a fraction by a nonzero whole number, we must multiply the numerator by that same nonzero whole number. Thus, when
converting
18 10
to a whole number by multiplying it by 10, we must also multiply the numerator

432 100
by 10.

43210=432)10 = 4321=432 100 )100 1 101 10

= 432 10
= 43.2We have converted the division 4.32  1.8 into the division 43.2  18, that is,
1.8)4.32  18)43.2Notice what has occurred.

If we "move" the decimal point of the divisor one digit to the right, we must also "move" the decimal point of the dividend one place to the right. The word "move" actually indicates the process of multiplication by a power of 10.
# CHAPTER 6. DECIMALS
Method of Dividing a Decimal by a Decimal Number To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal,
	1.	Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point to the position immediately to the right of the divisor's last digit.
	2.	Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor.
	3.	Set the decimal point in the quotient by placing a decimal point directly above the newly located decimal point in the dividend.
	4.	Divide as usual.
6.7.4.1 Sample Set B Find the following quotients.
Example 6.46
32.66  7.1
7.1)32.66
The divisor has one decimal place.Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 1 place to the right. Set the decimal point.Divide as usual.
Thus, 32.66  7.1 = 4.6.Check: 32.66  7.1 = 4.6 if 4.6  7.1 = 32.66
4.6 7.1 46
32232.66 True.
Example 6.47
1.0773  0.513

Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 3 places to the right. Set the decimal place and divide.
Thus, 1.0773  0.513 = 2.1.Checking by multiplying 2.1 and 0.513 will convince us that we have obtained the correct result.
(Try it.) Example 6.48
12  0.00032 0.00032)12.00000
The divisor has 5 decimal places.Move the decimal point of both the divisor and the dividend 5 places to the right. We will need


to add 5 zeros to 12.Set the decimal place and divide.
This is now the same as the division of whole numbers.

PAGE	'6.7.5 Calculators'
Calculators can be useful for nding quotients of decimal numbers. As we have seen with the other calculator operations, we can sometimes expect only approximate results. We are alerted to approximate results when the calculator display is lled with digits. We know it is possible that the operation may produce more digits than the calculator has the ability to show. For example, the multiplication
0.12345  0.4567  
5 decimal 4 decimal places places
produces 5 + 4 = 9 decimal places. An eight-digit display calculator only has the ability to show eight digits, and an approximation results. The way to recognize a possible approximation is illustrated in problem 3 of the next sample set.
6.7.5.1 Sample Set CFind each quotient using a calculator. If the result is an approximation, round to ve decimal places.
Example 6.49

This multiplication produces 3 + 7 = 10 decimal digits. But our suspected quotient contains only 8 decimal digits. We conclude that the answer is an approximation. Then, rounding to ve decimal places, we get 0.19974.

In problems 4 and 5 of Section 6.7.4.2 (Practice Set B), we found the decimal representations of 8, 162.41  10 and 8, 162.41  100. Let's look at each of these again and then, from these observations, make a general statement regarding division of a decimal number by a power of 10.

Thus, 8, 162.41  10 = 816.241.Notice that the divisor 10 is composed of one 0 and that the quotient 816.241 can be obtained from the
dividend 8,162.41 by moving the decimal point one place to the left.

Thus, 8, 162.41  100 = 81.6241.Notice that the divisor 100 is composed of two 0's and that the quotient 81.6241 can be obtained from the
dividend by moving the decimal point two places to the left.
Using these observations, we can suggest the following method for dividing decimal numbers by powers of 10.


Dividing a Decimal Fraction by a Power of 10To divide a decimal fraction by a power of 10, move the decimal point of the decimal fraction to the left as many places as there are zeros in the power of 10. Add zeros if necessary.
6.7.6.1 Sample Set D Find each quotient.
Example 6.52
9, 248.6  100
Since there are 2 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 2 places to the left.
Example 6.53
3.28  10, 000
Since there are 4 zeros in this power of 10, we move the decimal point 4 places to the left. To do so, we need to add three zeros.

		Nonterminating Divisions
		Denoting Nonterminating Quotients 6.8.2 Nonterminating Divisions Let's consider two divisions: 1. 9.8  3.5 2. 4  3
Terminating DivisionsPreviously, we have considered divisions like example 1, which is an example of a terminating division. A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after several divisions (the remainder is zero).
Exact DivisionsThe quotient in this problem terminates in the tenths position. Terminating divisions are also called exact divisions.
Nonterminating DivisionThe division in example 2 is an example of a nonterminating division. A non-terminating division is a division that, regardless of how far we carry it out, always has a remainder.


# CHAPTER 6. DECIMALS
Repeating DecimalWe can see that the pattern in the brace is repeated endlessly. Such a decimal quotient is called a repeating decimal.
PAGE	'6.8.3 Denoting Nonterminating QuotientsWe use three dots at the end of a number to indicate that a pattern repeats itself endlessly.'
4  3 = 1.333 ...Another way, aside from using three dots, of denoting an endlessly repeating pattern is to write a bar (  )
above the repeating sequence of digits.4  3 = 1.3The bar indicates the repeated pattern of 3.Repeating patterns in a division can be discovered in two ways:
	1.	As the division process progresses, should the remainder ever be the same as the dividend, it can be concluded that the division is nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.54 of Section 6.8.3.1 (Sample Set A).
	2.	As the division process progresses, should the "product, dierence" pattern ever repeat two consecutive times, it can be concluded that the division is nonterminating and that the pattern in the quotient repeats. This fact is illustrated in Example 6.55 and 4 of Section 6.8.3.1 (Sample Set A).
6.8.3.1 Sample Set ACarry out each division until the repeating pattern can be determined.
Example 6.54
100  27

3.70370 27)100.00000
81 19 0 18 9
100 81


When the remainder is identical to the dividend, the division is nonterminating. This implies that the pattern in the quotient repeats.
100  27 = 3.70370370 . . . The repeating block is 703. 100  27 = 3.703
Example 6.55
19
We see that this product, dierencepattern repeats. We can conclude that the division is nonter- minating and that the quotient repeats.
1  9 = 0.111 . . . The repeating block is 1. 19 = 0.1
Example 6.56
Divide 2 by 11 and round to 3 decimal places.
Since we wish to round the quotient to three decimal places, we'll carry out the division so that the quotient has four decimal places.

9 6.9 Converting a Fraction to a Decimal
Now that we have studied and practiced dividing with decimals, we are also able to convert a fraction to a
decimal. To do so we need only recall that a fraction bar can also be a division symbol. Thus, 3 not only 4
means "3 objects out of 4," but can also mean "3 divided by 4."

PAGE	'6.11.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Decimal Point (Section 6.2)A decimal point is a point that separates the units digit from the tenths digit.
Decimal or Decimal Fraction (Section 6.2)A decimal fraction is a fraction whose denominator is a power of ten.
# CHAPTER 6.
DECIMALS
Converting a Decimal to a Fraction (Section 6.3)Decimals can be converted to fractions by saying the decimal number in words, then writing what was said.
Rounding Decimals (Section 6.4)Decimals are rounded in much the same way whole numbers are rounded.
Addition and Subtraction of Decimals (Section 6.5) To add or subtract decimals,
	1.	Align the numbers vertically so that the decimal points line up under each other and the corresponding decimal positions are in the same column.
	2.	Add or subtract the numbers as if they were whole numbers.
	3.	Place a decimal point in the resulting sum directly under the other decimal points.
Multiplication of Decimals (Section 6.6) To multiply two decimals,
1. Multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers.2. Find the sum of the number of decimal places in the factors.3. The number of decimal places in the product is the number found in step 2.
Multiplying Decimals by Powers of 10 (Section 6.6)To multiply a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal point to the right as many places as there are
zeros in the power of ten. Add zeros if necessary.
Division of a Decimal by a Decimal (Section 6.7) To divide a decimal by a nonzero decimal,
	1.	Convert the divisor to a whole number by moving the decimal point until it appears to the right of the divisor's last digit.
	2.	Move the decimal point of the dividend to the right the same number of digits it was moved in the divisor.
	3.	Proceed to divide.
	4.	Locate the decimal in the answer by bringing it straight up from the dividend.
Dividing Decimals by Powers of 10 (Section 6.7)To divide a decimal by a power of 10, move the decimal point to the left as many places as there are zeros
in the power of ten. Add zeros if necessary.
Terminating Divisions (Section 6.8)A terminating division is a division in which the quotient terminates after several divisions. Terminating
divisions are also called exact divisions.



Nonterminating Divisions (Section 6.8)A nonterminating division is a division that, regardless of how far it is carried out, always has a remainder.
Nonterminating divisions are also called nonexact divisions.
Converting Fractions to Decimals (Section 6.9)A fraction can be converted to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator.

# CHAPTER 7. RATIOS AND RATES
PAGE	'7.2.2 Denominate Numbers and Pure Numbers'
Denominate Numbers, Like and Unlike Denominate NumbersIt is often necessary or convenient to compare two quantities. Denominate numbers are numbers together with some specied unit. If the units being compared are alike, the denominate numbers are called like denominate numbers. If units are not alike, the numbers are called unlike denominate numbers. Examples of denominate numbers are shown in the diagram:
Pure Numbers
Numbers that exist purely as numbers and do not represent amounts of quantities are called pure numbers.
Examples of pure numbers are 8, 254, 0, 21 5 , 2 , and 0.07. 85
Numbers can be compared in two ways: subtraction and division.
Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and DivisionComparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one number is than another. Comparison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one number is than another.
Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by SubtractionNumbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they both are like denominate numbers or both pure numbers.
7.2.2.1 Sample Set A
Example 7.1
Compare 8 miles and 3 miles by subtraction.
8 mile  3 miles = 5 milesThis means that 8 miles is 5 miles more than 3 miles.
Examples of use: I can now jog 8 miles whereas I used to jog only 3 miles. So, I can now jog 5 miles more than I used to.
Example 7.2
Compare 12 and 5 by subtraction.
12  5 = 7This means that 12 is 7 more than 5.
Example 7.3
Comparing 8 miles and 5 gallons by subtraction makes no sense.
8 miles  5 gallons =? Example 7.4
Compare 36 and 4 by division.
36  4 = 9
Thismeansthat36is9timesaslargeas4. Recallthat364=9canbeexpressedas 36 =9. 4

Example 7.5
Compare 8 miles and 2 miles by division.
8 miles = 4 2 miles
This means that 8 miles is 4 times as large as 2 miles.
Example of use: I can jog 8 miles to your 2 miles. Or, for every 2 miles that you jog, I jog 8. So, I jog 4 times as many miles as you jog.
Notice that when like quantities are being compared by division, we drop the units. Another way of looking at this is that the units divide out (cancel).
Example 7.6
Compare 30 miles and 2 gallons by division.
30 miles = 15 miles 2 gallons 1 gallon
Example of use: A particular car goes 30 miles on 2 gallons of gasoline. This is the same as getting 15 miles to 1 gallon of gasoline.
Notice that when the quantities being compared by division are unlike quantities, we do not drop the units.
RatioA comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers is a ratio.
36 8 milesThe comparison by division of the pure numbers 4 and the like denominate numbers 2 miles are examples
of ratios.
RateA comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate.
The comparison by division of two unlike denominate numbers, such as

and
40 dollars 5 tickets

# CHAPTER 7. RATIOS AND RATES are examples of rates.
Let's agree to represent two numbers (pure or denominate) with the letters a and b. This means that we're letting a represent some number and b represent some, perhaps dierent, number. With this agreement, we can write the ratio of the two numbers a and b as
a or b ba
Theratio a isreadas"atob." b
Theratio b isreadas"btoa." a
Since a ratio or a rate can be expressed as a fraction, it may be reducible.

7.2.3.1 Sample Set B Example 7.7
30 15 The ratio 30 to 2 can be expressed as 2 . Reducing, we get 1 .

The ratio 30 to 2 is equivalent to the ratio 15 to 1.
Example 7.8
The rate "4 televisions to 12 people" can be expressed as
that "for every 4 televisions, there are 12 people."
4 televisions 12 people
. The meaning of this rate is

Reducing, we get people.
1 television 3 people
. The meaning of this rate is that "for every 1 television, there are 3

Thus, the rate of "4 televisions to 12 people" is the same as the rate of "1 television to 3 people."

# CHAPTER 7. RATIOS AND RATES

Many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as proportions. Such proportions will be composed of three specied numbers and one unknown number. It is customary to let a letter, such as x, represent the unknown number. An example of such a proportion is
x = 20 4 16
This proportion is read as " x is to 4 as 20 is to 16."There is a method of solving these proportions that is based on the equality of fractions. Recall that two
fractions are equivalent if and only if their cross products are equal. For example,
Notice that in a proportion that contains three specied numbers and a letter representing an unknown quantity, that regardless of where the letter appears, the following situation always occurs.
(number)  (letter) = (number)  (number)   
We recognize this as a multiplication statement. Specically, it is a missing factor statement. (See Section 4.7 for a discussion of multiplication statements.) For example,

x=20 4 16
4=16 x 20
5=x 4 16
5=20 4x
meansthat 16x=420 meansthat 420=16x meansthat 516=4x meansthat 5x=420

Each of these statements is a multiplication statement. Specically, each is a missing factor statement. (The letter used here is x, whereas M was used in Section 4.7.)
Finding the Missing Factor in a ProportionThe missing factor in a missing factor statement can be determined by dividing the product by the known factor, that is, if x represents the missing factor, thenx = (product)  (known factor)
7.3.3.1 Sample Set BFind the unknown number in each proportion.

PAGE	'7.3.4 Proportions Involving Rates'
Recall that a rate is a comparison, by division, of unlike denominate numbers. We must be careful when setting up proportions that involve rates. The form is important. For example, if a rate involves two types of units, say unit type 1 and unit type 2, we can write
or
Both cross products produce a statement of the type (unit type 1)  (unit type 2) = (unit type 1)  (unit type 2) which we take to mean the comparison
Examples of correctly expressed proportions are the following:
However, if we write the same type of units on dierent sides, such as,
unit type 1 = unit type 2 unit type 2 unit type 1
the cross product produces a statement of the form


We can see that this is an incorrect comparison by observing the following example: It is incorrect to write
2 hooks = 6 poles 3 poles 4 hooks
for two reason.
1. The cross product is numerically wrong: (2  4 = 3  6).2. The cross product produces the statement hooks are to hooks as poles are to poles, which makes no

sense.

PAGE	'7.4.2 The Five-Step Method'
In Section 7.3 we noted that many practical problems can be solved by writing the given information as proportions. Such proportions will be composed of three specied numbers and one unknown number represented by a letter.
The rst and most important part of solving a proportion problem is to determine, by careful reading, what the unknown quantity is and to represent it with some letter.
The Five-Step MethodThe ve-step method for solving proportion problems:
	1.	By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a problem.
	2.	Identify the three specied numbers.
	3.	Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the proportion.
	4.	Solve the proportion (using the methods of Section 7.3).
	5.	Interpret and write a conclusion in a sentence with the appropriate units of measure.
Step 1 is extremely important. Many problems go unsolved because time is not taken to establish what quantity is to be found.
When solving an applied problem, always begin by determining the unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.

Step 1: The unknown quantity is miles.Let x = number of miles represented by 8 inches
Step 2: The three specied numbers are 2 inches
25 miles
8 inchesStep 3: The comparisons are
2 inches to 25 miles  2 inches 25 miles
8 inches to x miles  8 inches x miles
Proportions involving ratios and rates are more readily solved by suspending the units while
doing the computations.

Ratio, PercentWe dened a ratio as a comparison, by division, of two pure numbers or two like denominate numbers. A most convenient number to compare numbers to is 100. Ratios in which one number is compared to 100 are called percents. The word percent comes from the Latin word "per centum." The word "per" means "for each" or "for every," and the word "centum" means "hundred." Thus, we have the following denition.
Percent means for each hundred," or "for every hundred." The symbol % is used to represent the word percent.

To Convert a Fraction
To Convert a Decimal
To Convert a Percent
To a decimal: Divide the numer- ator by the denominator
To a fraction: Read the decimal and reduce the resulting fraction
To a decimal: Move the decimal point 2 places to the left and drop the % symbol
To a percent: Convert the frac- tion rst to a decimal, then move the decimal point 2 places to the right and ax the % symbol.
To a percent: Move the decimal point 2 places to the right and af- x the % symbol
To a fraction: Drop the % sign and write the number over 100. Reduce, if possible.
7.5.3.1 Sample Set B
Example 7.27
Convert 12% to a decimal.
12% = 12 = 0.12 100
Note that
Table 7.1

The % symbol is dropped, and the decimal point moves 2 places to the left.
Example 7.28
Convert 0.75 to a percent.
0.75= 75 =75% 100
Note that
The % symbol is axed, and the decimal point moves 2 units to the right. Example 7.29
Convert 3 to a percent. 5

We see in Example 7.28 that we can convert a decimal to a percent. We also know that we can convert a fraction to a decimal. Thus, we can see that if we rst convert the fraction to a decimal, we can then convert the decimal to a percent.

PAGE	'7.6.3 Conversions Involving Nonterminating FractionsWe must be careful when changing a fraction of 1% to a decimal. The number 2, as we know, has a'

nonterminating decimal representation. Therefore, it cannot be expressed exactly as a decimal.
When converting nonterminating fractions of 1% to decimals, it is customary to express the fraction as a rounded decimal with at least three decimal places.
Converting a Nonterminating Fraction to a Decimal To convert a nonterminating fraction of 1% to a decimal:
1. Convert the fraction as a rounded decimal.2. Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the percent sign.
7.6.3.1 Sample Set B Example 7.33
Convert 2 % to a three-place decimal. 3
	1.	Convert 2 to a decimal. 3 Since we wish the resulting decimal to have three decimal digits, and removing the percent sign will account for two of them, we need to round 2 to one place (2 + 1 = 3). 3
	2.	Move the decimal point two digits to the left and remove the % sign. We'll need to add zeros to locate the decimal point in the correct location. 2 % = 0.007 to 3 decimal places 3
Example 7.34!!!
Convert 5 4 % to a four-place decimal. 11
	1.	Since we wish the resulting decimal to have four decimal places, and removing the percent sign will account for two, we to round 4 to two places. 11  5 4 % = 5.36% to two decimal places. 4 = 0.3636...
	2.	Move the decimal point two places to the left and drop the percent sign. 5 4 % = 0.0536 to 11 four decimal places.

2% = 0.7% to one decimal place. 2 = 0.6666... 33

Convert 285% to a decimal rounded to ten thousandths.


1. Since we wish the resulting decimal to be rounded to ten thousandths (four decimal places),
and removing the percent sign will account for two, we need to round 5 to two places.

285% = 28.56% to two decimal places. 5 = 0.5555... 9 99

# CHAPTER 7.
RATIOS AND RATES
There are three basic types of percent problems. Each type involves a base, a percent, and a percentage, and when they are translated from words to mathematical symbols each becomes a multiplication statement. Examples of these types of problems are the following:
1. What number is 30% of 50? (Missing product statement.) 2. 15 is what percent of 50? (Missing factor statement.)3. 15 is 30% of what number? (Missing factor statement.)
In problem 1 (list, p. 448), the product is missing. To solve the problem, we represent the missing product with P.
P = 30%  50
PercentageThe missing product P is called the percentage. Percentage means part, or portion. In P = 30%  50, P represents a particular part of 50.
In problem 2 (list, p. 448), one of the factors is missing. Here we represent the missing factor with Q. 15 =Q50
PercentThe missing factor is the percent. Percent, we know, means per 100, or part of 100. In 15 = Q  50, Q indicates what part of 50 is being taken or considered. Specically, 15 = Q  50 means that if 50 was to be divided into 100 equal parts, then Q indicates 15 are being considered.
In problem 3 (list, p. 448), one of the factors is missing. Represent the missing factor with B. 15 = 30%  B
BaseThe missing factor is the base. Some meanings of base are a source of supply, or a starting place. In 15 = 30%  B, B indicates the amount of supply. Specically, 15 = 30%  B indicates that 15 represents 30% of the total supply.
Each of these three types of problems is of the form
(percentage) = (percent)  (base)
We can determine any one of the three values given the other two using the methods discussed in Section 4.7.

7.7.3.1 Sample Set A
Example 7.36
What number is 30% of 50?
Missing product statement.
Convert 30% to a decimal. Multiply.
(percentage) = (percent)  (base) 
P = 30%  50 P = .30  50 P = 15
Thus, 15 is 30% of 50.
Do Section 7.7.3.2 (Practice Set A), Exercise 7.7.1. Example 7.37
What number is 36% of 95?
Missing product statement.
Convert 36% to a decimal. Multiply


  


  

(percentage) = (percent)  (base) 
P= 36%  95 P= .36  95 P = 34.2
Thus, 34.2 is 36% of 95.
Do Section 7.7.3.2 (Practice Set A), Exercise 7.7.1.
Example 7.38
A salesperson, who gets a commission of 12% of each sale she makes, makes a sale of $8,400.00.
How much is her commission?We need to determine what part of $8,400.00 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage.
What number is 12% of 8, 400.00?
Missing product statement.
P = 12%  8, 400.00P = .12  8,400.00 Multiply. P = 1008.00
Thus, the salesperson's commission is $1,008.00.
Do Section 7.7.3.2 (Practice Set A), Exercise 7.7.2.
Example 7.39
A girl, by practicing typing on her home computer, has been able to increase her typing speed by
110%. If she originally typed 16 words per minute, by how many words per minute was she able to increase her speed?
We need to determine what part of 16 has been taken. What part indicates percentage.

What number is 110% of 16?

  

(percentage) = (percent)  (base) 
P = 110%  16 P = 1.10  16 P = 17.6
Thus, the girl has increased her typing speed by 17.6 words per minute. Her new speed is 16 + 17.6 = 33.6 words per minute.
Do Section 7.7.3.2 (Practice Set A), Exercise 7.7.3.
Example 7.40
A student who makes $125 a month working part-time receives a 4% salary raise. What is the
student's new monthly salary?
With a 4% raise, this student will make 100% of the original salary + 4% of the original salary. This means the new salary will be 104% of the original salary. We need to determine what part of $125 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage.
What number is 104% of 125
Missing product statement.
Convert to decimals. Multiply.

  

(percentage) = (percent)  (base) 
P = 104%  125 P = 1.04  125 P = 130
Thus, this student's new monthly salary is $130.
Do Section 7.7.3.2 (Practice Set A), Exercise 7.7.4.
Example 7.41
An article of clothing is on sale at 15% o the marked price. If the marked price is $24.95, what
is the sale price?
Since the item is discounted 15%, the new price will be 100%  15% = 85% of the marked price. We need to determine what part of 24.95 is to be taken. What part indicates percentage.
What number is 85% of $24.95.
Missing product statement.
Convert to decimals. Multiply.Since this number represents money, we'll round to 2 decimal places

  

(percentage) = (percent)  (base) 
P = 85%  P = .85 
P = 21.2075 P = 21.21

A clothing item is priced at $20.40. This marked price includes a 15% discount. What is the
original price?
We need to determine the original price. We can think of the original price as the starting place. Starting place indicates base. We need to determine the base. The new price, $20.40, represents 100%  15% = 85% of the original price.

8 7.8 Summary of Key Concepts
PAGE	'7.8.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Denominate Numbers (Section 7.2)Numbers that appear along with units are denominate numbers. The amounts 6 dollars and 4 pints are examples of denominate numbers.
Like and Unlike Denominate Numbers (Section 7.2)Like denominate numbers are denominate numbers with like units. If the units are not the same, the numbers are unlike denominate numbers.
Pure Numbers (Section 7.2)Numbers appearing without a unit are pure numbers.
Comparing Numbers by Subtraction and Division (Section 7.2)Comparison of two numbers by subtraction indicates how much more one number is than another. Compar- ison by division indicates how many times larger or smaller one number is than another.
Comparing Pure or Like Denominate Numbers by Subtraction (Section 7.2)Numbers can be compared by subtraction if and only if they are pure numbers or like denominate numbers.
Ratio Rate (Section 7.2)A comparison, by division, of two like denominate numbers is a ratio. A comparison, by division, of two unlike denominate numbers is a rate.
Proportion (Section 7.3)A proportion is a statement that two ratios or rates are equal.
3 people = 6 people is a proportion. 2 jobs 4 jobs
Solving a Proportion (Section 7.3)To solve a proportion that contains three known numbers and a letter that represents an unknown quantity, perform the cross multiplication, then divide the product of the two numbers by the number that multiplies the letter.
Proportions Involving Rates (Section 7.3)When writing a proportion involving rates it is very important to write it so that the same type of units appears on the same side of either the equal sign or the fraction bar.
unittype1 =unittype1 or unittype1 =unittype2 unit type 2 unit type 2 unit type 1 unit type 2
Five-Step Method for Solving Proportions (Section 7.4)
	1.	By careful reading, determine what the unknown quantity is and represent it with some letter. There will be only one unknown in a problem.
	2.	Identify the three specied numbers.
	3.	Determine which comparisons are to be made and set up the proportion.
	4.	Solve the proportion.
	5.	Interpret and write a conclusion.
When solving applied problems, ALWAYS begin by determining the unknown quantity and representing it with a letter.

# CHAPTER 8. TECHNIQUES OF ESTIMATION
# The rounding that is done in estimation does not always follow the rules of rounding discussed in Section 1.4 (Rounding Whole Numbers). Since estimation is concerned with the expected value of a computation, rounding is done using convenience as the guide rather than using hard-and-fast rounding rules. For example, if we wish to estimate the result of the division 80  26, we might round 26 to 20 rather than to 30 since 80 is more conveniently divided by 20 than by 30.
# Since rounding may occur out of convenience, and dierent people have dierent ideas of what may be convenient, results of an estimation done by rounding may vary. For a particular computation, dierent people may get dierent estimated results. Results may vary.
# EstimationEstimation is the process of determining an expected value of a computation.
# Common words used in estimation are about, near, and between.
PAGE	'8.2.2 Estimation by Rounding'
The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits.
8.2.2.1 Sample Set A Example 8.1
Estimate the sum: 2,357 + 6,106. Notice that 2,357 is near 2, 400,
  
two nonzero digits
and that 6,106 is near
6, 100.   
two nonzero digits

The sum can be estimated by 2,400 + 6,100 = 8,500. (It is quick and easy to add 24 and 61.) Thus, 2,357 + 6,106 is about 8,400. In fact, 2,357 + 6,106 = 8,463.
8.2.2.2 Practice Set A Exercise
8.2.1
Estimate the sum: 4,216 + 3,942. Exercise 8.2.2
Estimate the sum: 812 + 514. Exercise 8.2.3
Estimate the sum: 43,892 + 92,106.
8.2.2.3 Sample Set B
Example 8.2
Estimate the dierence: 5, 203  3, 015.
Notice that 5,203 is near 5, 200,   
two nonzero digits
and that 3,015 is near
3, 000.   
one nonzero digit

Thus, 5, 203  3, 015 is about 2,200. In fact, 5, 203  3, 015 = 2,188.
We could make a less accurate estimation by observing that 5,203 is near 5,000. The number 5,000 has only one nonzero digit rather than two (as does 5,200). This fact makes the estimation quicker (but a little less accurate). We then estimate the dierence by 5, 000  3, 000 = 2,000, and conclude that 5, 203  3, 015 is about 2,000. This is why we say "answers may vary."
8.2.2.4 Practice Set B Exercise
8.2.4
Estimate the dierence: 628  413. Exercise 8.2.5
Estimate the dierence: 7, 842  5, 209. Exercise 8.2.6
Estimate the dierence: 73, 812  28, 492.
8.2.2.5 Sample Set C Example 8.3
Estimate the product: 73  46. Notice that 73 is near 70,

one nonzero digit
and that 46 is near
50. 
one nonzero digit
The product can be estimated by 70  50 = 3,500. (Recall that to multiply numbers ending in zeros, we multiply the nonzero digits and ax to this product the total number of ending zeros in the factors. See Section 2.2 for a review of this technique.)
Thus, 73  46 is about 3,500. In fact, 73  46 = 3,358. Example 8.4
Estimate the product: 87  4,316. Notice that 87 is close to 90,

one nonzero digit
and that 4,316 is close to
4, 000.   
one nonzero digit


The product can be estimated by 90  4,000 = 360,000.Thus, 87  4,316 is about 360,000. In fact, 87  4,316 = 375,492.

# CHAPTER 8.
and that 17 is close to 15. 
TECHNIQUES OF ESTIMATION
Notice that 153 is close to
150, 
two nonzero digits
The quotient can be estimated by 150  15 = 10. Thus, 153  17 is about 10. In fact, 153  17 = 9.
Example 8.6

ClusterWhen more than two numbers are to be added, the sum may be estimated using the clustering technique. The rounding technique could also be used, but if several of the numbers are seen to cluster (are seen to be close to) one particular number, the clustering technique provides a quicker estimate. Consider a sum such as
32 + 68 + 29 + 73 Notice two things:
1. There are more than two numbers to be added. 2. Clustering occurs.

# CHAPTER 8. TECHNIQUES OF ESTIMATION
PAGE	'8.4.2 The Distributive Property'
Distributive PropertyThe distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and multiplication. It is used often in algebra, and we can use it now to obtain exact results for a multiplication.
Suppose we wish to compute 3 (2 + 5). We can proceed in either of two ways, one way which is known to us already (the order of operations), and a new way (the distributive property).
1. Compute 3 (2 + 5) using the order of operations. 3(2 + 5)
Operate inside the parentheses rst: 2 + 5 = 7. 3 (2 + 5) = 3  7Now multiply 3 and 7.3 (2 + 5) = 3  7 = 21
Thus, 3 (2 + 5) = 21.2. Compute 3 (2 + 5) using the distributive property.
We know that multiplication describes repeated addition. Thus,
3(2+5) =
= = = =
2+5+2+5+2+5
  
2 + 5 appears 3 times
2+2+2+5+5+5 3  2 + 3  5 6+1521
(by the commutative property of addition) (since multiplication describes repeated addition)

Thus, 3 (2 + 5) = 21.Let's look again at this use of the distributive property.
3(2+5) =
3(2+5) =
2+5+2+5+2+5
  
2 + 5 appears 3 times
2+2+2 + 5+5+5
     
2 appears 3 times 5 appears 3 times

The 3 has been distributed to the 2 and 5.
This is the distributive property. We distribute the factor to each addend in the parentheses. The distributive property works for both sums and dierences.
8.4.2.1 Sample Set A Example 8.15
Using the order of operations, we get
4(6+2) = 48 = 32

We can use the distributive property to obtain exact results for products such as 25  23. The distributive property works best for products when one of the factors ends in 0 or 5. We shall restrict our attention to only such products.
8.4.3.1 Sample Set BUse the distributive property to compute each value.
Example 8.19

Notice that 23 = 20 + 3. We now write

Example 8.20
15  37
Notice that 37 = 30 + 7. We now write
Thus, 15  37 = 555We could have proceeded by writing 37 as 40  3.

PAGE	'8.6.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
# CHAPTER 8. TECHNIQUES OF ESTIMATION
Estimation (Section 8.2)Estimation is the process of determining an expected value of a computation.
Estimation By Rounding (Section 8.2)The rounding technique estimates the result of a computation by rounding the numbers involved in the computation to one or two nonzero digits. For example, 512 + 896 can be estimated by 500 + 900 = 1,400.
Cluster (Section 8.3)When several numbers are close to one particular number, they are said to cluster near that particular number.
Estimation By Clustering (Section 8.3)The clustering technique of estimation can be used when
1. there are more than two numbers to be added, and 2. clustering occurs.
For example, 31 + 62 + 28 + 59 can be estimated by (2  30) + (2  60) = 60 + 120 = 180
Distributive Property (Section 8.4)The distributive property is a characteristic of numbers that involves both addition and multiplication. For example,3 (4 + 6) = 3  4 + 3  6 = 12 + 18 = 30
Estimation Using the Distributive Property (Section 8.4)The distributive property can be used to obtain exact results for a multiplication. For example,15  23 = 15  (20 + 3) = 15  20 + 15  3 = 300 + 45 = 345
Estimation by Rounding Fractions (Section 8.5)Estimation by rounding fractions commonly rounds fractions to 1 , 1 , 3 , 0, and 1.


For example,5 +5 canbeestimatedby1+1=3

# 9.2 Measurement and the United States System

 Measurement
		The United States System of Measurement
		Conversions in the United States System 9.2.2 Measurement
There are two major systems of measurement in use today. They are the United States system and the metric system. Before we describe these systems, let's gain a clear understanding of the concept of measurement.
MeasurementMeasurement is comparison to some standard.
Standard Unit of MeasureThe concept of measurement is based on the idea of direct comparison. This means that measurement is the result of the comparison of two quantities. The quantity that is used for comparison is called the standard unit of measure.
Over the years, standards have changed. Quite some time in the past, the standard unit of measure was determined by a king. For example,
1 inch was the distance between the tip of the thumb and the knuckle of the king. 1 inch was also the length of 16 barley grains placed end to end.
Today, standard units of measure rarely change. Standard units of measure are the responsibility of the Bureau of Standards in Washington D.C.
Some desirable properties of a standard are the following:
	1.	Accessibility. We should have access to the standard so we can make comparisons.
	2.	Invariance. We should be condent that the standard is not subject to change.
	3.	Reproducibility. We should be able to reproduce the standard so that measurements are convenient and accessible to many people.
PAGE	'9.2.3 The United States System of Measurement'
Some of the common units (along with their abbreviations) for the United States system of measurement are listed in the following table.
Unit Conversion Table
Length
1 foot (ft) = 12 inches (in.) 1 yard (yd) = 3 feet (ft)1 mile (mi) = 5,280 feet
continued on next page


It is often convenient or necessary to convert from one unit of measure to another. For example, it may be convenient to convert a measurement of length that is given in feet to one that is given in inches. Such conversions can be made using unit fractions.
Unit FractionA unit fraction is a fraction with a value of 1.
Unit fractions are formed by using two equal measurements. One measurement is placed in the numerator of the fraction, and the other in the denominator. Placement depends on the desired conversion.
Placement of UnitsPlace the unit being converted to in the numerator. Place the unit being converted from in the denominator.
For example,
Table 9.2
9.2.4.1 Sample Set AMake the following conversions. If a fraction occurs, convert it to a decimal rounded to two decimal places.
Example 9.1
Convert 11 yards to feet.
Looking in the unit conversion table under length, we see that 1 yd = 3 ft. There are two corre-
1 yd sponding unit fractions, and
3 ft 1 yd
. Which one should we use? Look to see which unit we wish

# CHAPTER 9. MEASUREMENT AND GEOMETRY
this unit fraction has feet in the numerator. Now, multiply 11 yd by the unit fraction. Notice that since the unit fraction has the value of 1, multiplying by it does not change the value of 11 yd.

Example 9.2
Convert 36  oz to pints.
Looking in the unit conversion table under liquid volume, we see that 1 pt = 16  oz. Since we are to convert to pints, we will construct a unit fraction with pints in the numerator.
Divide out common units.(Units can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided, just as numbers can.)

33ft Thus, 11 yd = 33ft.
36  oz  1 pt 1 16  oz

36 oz = = = = =
Thus, 36  oz = 2.25 pt. Example 9.3
Convert 2,016 hr to weeks.
Looking in the unit conversion table under time, we see that 1wk = 7da and that 1 da = 24 hr. To convert from hours to weeks, we must rst convert from hours to days and then from days to weeks. We need two unit fractions.

PAGE	'9.3.1 Section Overview'
 The Advantages of the Base Ten Number System  Prexes
		Conversion from One Unit to Another Unit
		Conversion Table 9.3.2 The Advantages of the Base Ten Number System
The metric system of measurement takes advantage of our base ten number system. The advantage of the metric system over the United States system is that in the metric system it is possible to convert from one unit of measure to another simply by multiplying or dividing the given number by a power of 10. This means we can make a conversion simply by moving the decimal point to the right or the left.
PAGE	'9.3.3 Prexes'
Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (for length), the liter (for volume), and the gram (for mass). To each of the units can be attached a prex. The metric prexes along with their meaning are listed below.
Metric Prexes
kilo  thousand deci  tenth hecto  hundred centi  hundredth deka  ten
milli  thousandthFor example, if length is being measured,
1 kilometer is equivalent to 1000 meters.1 centimeter is equivalent to one hundredth of a meter. 1 millimeter is equivalent to one thousandth of a meter.
PAGE	'9.3.4 Conversion from One Unit to Another UnitLet's note three characteristics of the metric system that occur in the metric table of measurements.'
1. In each category, the prexes are the same.2. We can move from a larger to a smaller unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the right. 3. We can move from a smaller to a larger unit of measure by moving the decimal point to the left.
The following table provides a summary of the relationship between the basic unit of measure (meter, gram, liter) and each prex, and how many places the decimal point is moved and in what direction.

Distinction Between Mass and WeightThere is a distinction between mass and weight. The weight of a body is related to gravity whereas the mass of a body is not. For example, your weight on the earth is dierent than it is on the moon, but your mass is the same in both places. Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to motion. The more massive a body, the more resistant it is to motion. Also, more massive bodies weigh more than less massive bodies.
Converting Metric UnitsTo convert from one metric unit to another metric unit:
1. Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale (pictured in each of the following examples).
2. Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish to go to.
We can also convert from one metric unit to another using unit fractions. Both methods are shown in Example 9.4 of Section 9.3.5.1 (Sample Set A).
9.3.5.1 Sample Set A
Example 9.4
Convert 3 kilograms to grams.
(a) 3 kg can be written as 3.0 kg. Then,
Thus, 3kg = 3,000 g.(b) We can also use unit fractions to make this conversion. Since we are converting to grams, and
1, 000 g = 1 kg, we choose the unit fraction 1,000 g since grams is in the numerator. 1 kg

		Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number 9.4.2 Converting to Multiple Units
Denominate NumbersNumbers that have units of measure associated with them are called denominate numbers. It is often convenient, or even necessary, to simplify a denominate number.
Simplied Denominate NumberA denominate number is simplied when the number of standard units of measure associated With it does not exceed the next higher type of unit.
The denominate number 55 min is simplied since it is smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min is not simplied since it is not smaller than the next higher type of unit, 1 hr. The denominate number 65 min can be simplied to 1 hr 5 min. The denominate number 1 hr 5 min is simplied since the next higher type of unit is day, and 1 hr does not exceed 1 day.
9.4.2.1 Sample Set A

Recalling that multiplication is a description of repeated addition, by the distributive property we have

3(4 ft 9 in.)
= 3 (4 ft + 9 in.)= 34 ft +39 in. = 12 ft + 27 in.= 12ft+2ft+3in. = 14 ft + 3 in.

We can make use of conversion skills with denominate numbers to make measurements of geometric gures such as rectangles, triangles, and circles. To make these measurements we need to be familiar with several denitions.
PolygonA polygon is a closed plane (at) gure whose sides are line segments (portions of straight lines).
Polygons
Not polygons
PAGE	'9.5.3 Perimeter'
PerimeterThe perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon.
To nd the perimeter of a polygon, we simply add up the lengths of all the sides.
9.5.3.1 Sample Set AFind the perimeter of each polygon.

Perimeter = 2cm+5cm+2cm+5cm = 14 cm

CircumferenceThe circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle.
DiameterA diameter of a circle is any line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has its endpoints on the circle.

RadiusA radius of a circle is any line segment having as its endpoints the center of the circle and a point on the circle.The radius is one half the diameter.

The symbol , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal number 3.14159 ... . This number has been computed to millions of decimal places without the appearance of a repeating block of digits.
For computational purposes,  is often approximated as 3.14. We will write   3.14 to denote that  is approximately equal to 3.14. The symbol "" means "approximately equal to."
PAGE	'9.5.6 Formulas'
To nd the circumference of a circle, we need only know its diameter or radius. We then use a formula for computing the circumference of the circle.
FormulaA formula is a rule or method for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a rule that directs us in computations.
Formulas are usually composed of letters that represent important, but possibly unknown, quantities.
If C, d, and r represent, respectively, the circumference, diameter, and radius of a circle, then the following two formulas give us directions for computing the circumference of the circle.

		Finding Volumes of Some Common Geometric Objects
Quite often it is necessary to multiply one denominate number by another. To do so, we multiply the number parts together and the unit parts together. For example,
8 in.8 in. = 88 in.in. = 64 in.2
4mm 4 mm4 mm = 444mmmmmm = 64 mm3
Sometimes the product of units has a physical meaning. In this section, we will examine the meaning of the products (length unit)2 and (length unit)3.
PAGE	'9.6.2 The Meaning and Notation for Area'
The product (length unit)  (length unit) = (length unit)2, or, square length unit (sq length unit), can be interpreted physically as the area of a surface.
AreaThe area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the surface.
For example, 3 sq in. means that 3 squares, 1 inch on each side, can be placed precisely on some surface. (The squares may have to be cut and rearranged so they match the shape of the surface.)

7 9.7 Summary of Key Concepts
PAGE	'9.7.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Measurement (Section 9.2)Measurement is comparison to some standard.
Standard Unit of Measure (Section 9.2)A quantity that is used for comparison is called a standard unit of measure.
Two Types of Measurement Systems (Section 9.2)There are two major types of measurement systems in use today. They are the United States system and the metric system.
Unit Fraction (Section 9.2)A unit fraction is a fraction that has a value of 1. Unit fractions can be used to convert from one unit of measure to another.
Meter, Liter, Gram, and associated prexes (Section 9.3)Common units of measure in the metric system are the meter (m), for length, the liter (L), for volume, and the gram (g), for mass. To each of these units, a prex can be attached.
kilo  deci  hecto  centi  deka  milli 
thousand tenth
hundred hundredth
ten thousandth
Metric Conversions (Section 9.3)To convert from one metric unit to another:
	1.	Determine the location of the original number on the metric scale.
	2.	Move the decimal point of the original number in the same direction and the same number of places as is necessary to move to the metric unit you wish to convert to.
Denominate Numbers (Section 9.4)Numbers that have units of measure associated with them are denominate numbers. The number 25 mg is a denominate number since the mg unit is associated with the pure number 25. The number 82 is not a denominate number since it has no unit of measure associated with it.
Simplied Denominate Number (Section 9.4)A denominate number is simplied when the number of standard units of measure associated with it does not exceed the next higher type of unit. 55 min is simplied, whereas 65 min is not simplied
Addition and Subtraction of Denominate Numbers (Section 9.4) Denominate numbers can be added or subtracted by
1. writing the numbers vertically so that the like units appear in the same column. 2. adding or subtracting the number parts, carrying along the unit.3. simplifying the sum or dierence.



# CHAPTER 9. MEASUREMENT AND GEOMETRY
Multiplying a Denominate Number by a Whole Number (Section 9.4)To multiply a denominate number by a whole number, multiply the number part of each unit by the whole number and ax the unit to the product.
Dividing a Denominate Number by a Whole Number (Section 9.4)To divide a denominate number by a whole number, divide the number part of each unit by the whole number beginning with the largest unit. Ax the unit to this quotient. Carry the remainder to the next unit.
Polygon (Section 9.5)A polygon is a closed plane (at) gure whose sides are line segments (portions of straight lines).
Perimeter (Section 9.5)The perimeter of a polygon is the distance around the polygon.
Circumference, Diameter, Radius (Section 9.5)The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle. The diameter of a circle is any line segment that passes through the center of the circle and has its endpoints on the circle. The radius of a circle is one half the diameter of the circle.
The number  (Section 9.5)The symbol , read "pi," represents the nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal number 3.14159... . For computational purposes,  is often approximated by the number 3.14.
Formula (Section 9.5)A formula is a rule for performing a task. In mathematics, a formula is a rule that directs us in computations.
Circumference Formulas (Section 9.5) C =   d C  (3.14) d
Volume (Section 9.6)The volume of an object is a measure of the amount of cubic length units contained in the object.
Area Formulas (Section 9.6) Triangle: A = 1  b  h

Rectangle: A = l  w
Parallelogram: A = b  h
Trapezoid: A = 1  (b1 + b2)  h 2
Circle: A=r2
Volume Formulas (Section 9.6)
Rectangle solid: V =lwh
Sphere: V = 4 r3 3
Cylinder: V =   r2  h
Cone: V = 1    r2  h 3
C  2 (3.14) rThe area of a surface is the amount of square length units contained in the surface.
C = 2    rArea (Section 9.6)

# 10.2 Variables, Constants, and Real Numbers
PAGE	'10.2.1 Section Overview'
		Variables and Constants
		Real Numbers
		Subsets of Real Numbers
		Ordering Real Numbers 10.2.2 Variables and Constants

A basic distinction between algebra and arithmetic is the use of symbols (usually letters) in algebra to represent numbers. So, algebra is a generalization of arithmetic. Let us look at two examples of situations in which letters are substituted for numbers:
	1.	Suppose that a student is taking four college classes, and each class can have at most 1 exam per week. In any 1-week period, the student may have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 exams. In algebra, we can let the letter x represent the number of exams this student may have in a 1-week period. The letter x may assume any of the various values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
	2.	Suppose that in writing a term paper for a biology class a student needs to specify the average lifetime, in days, of a male housey. If she does not know this number o the top of her head, she might represent it (at least temporarily) on her paper with the letter t (which reminds her of time). Later, she could look up the average time in a reference book and nd it to be 17 days. The letter t can assume only the one value, 17, and no other values. The value t is constant.
Variable, Constant
1. A letter or symbol that represents any member of a collection of two or more numbers is called a variable.
2. A letter or symbol that represents one specic number, known or unknown, is called a constant.
In example 1, the letter x is a variable since it can represent any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The letter t example 2 is a constant since it can only have the value 17.
PAGE	'10.2.3 Real Numbers'
Real Number LineThe study of mathematics requires the use of several collections of numbers. The real number line allows us to visually display (graph) the numbers in which we are interested.
A line is composed of innitely many points. To each point we can associate a unique number, and with each number, we can associate a particular point.
CoordinateThe number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point.
GraphThe point on a number line that is associated with a particular number is called the graph of that number.
Constructing a Real Number Line We construct a real number line as follows:


	1.	Draw a horizontal line.
	2.	OriginChoose any point on the line and label it 0. This point is called the origin.
3. Choose a convenient length. Starting at 0, mark this length o in both directions, being careful to have the lengths look like they are about the same.
We now dene a real number.
Real NumberA real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line.
Positive Numbers, Negative NumbersReal numbers whose graphs are to the right of 0 are called positive real numbers, or more simply, positive numbers. Real numbers whose graphs appear to the left of 0 are called negative real numbers, or more simply, negative numbers.
The number 0 is neither positive nor negative.
PAGE	'10.2.4 Subsets of Real Numbers'
The set of real numbers has many subsets. Some of the subsets that are of interest in the study of algebra are listed below along with their notations and graphs.
Natural Numbers, Counting NumbersThe natural or counting numbers (N): 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . Read and so on.
Whole NumbersThe whole numbers (W): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
Notice that every natural number is a whole number. Integers
Theintegers(Z): . . . -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,. . . Notice that every whole number is an integer.
Rational Numbers (Fractions)The rational numbers (Q): Rational numbers are sometimes called fractions. They are numbers that can be written as the quotient of two integers. They have decimal representations that either terminate or do not terminate but contain a repeating block of digits. Some examples are
3 = 0.75 811 = 8.407407407... 4 27
     
Terminating Nonterminating, but repeating


# CHAPTER 10. SIGNED NUMBERS Some rational numbers are graphed below.
Notice that every integer is a rational number.
Notice that there are still a great many points on the number line that have not yet been assigned a type of number. We will not examine these other types of numbers in this text. They are examined in detail in algebra. An example of these numbers is the number , whose decimal representation does not terminate nor contain a repeating block of digits. An approximation for  is 3.14.

PAGE	'10.2.5 Ordering Real Numbers'
Ordering Real NumbersA real number b is said to be greater than a real number a, denoted b > a, if b is to the right of a on the number line. Thus, as we would expect, 5 > 2 since 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line. Also, 2 >  5 since -2 is to the right of -5 on the number line.
If we let a and b represent two numbers, then a and b are related in exactly one of three ways: Either

10.3 Signed Numbers
PAGE	'10.3.1 Section Overview'
Positive and Negative NumbersEach real number other than zero has a sign associated with it. A real number is said to be a positive number if it is to the right of 0 on the number line and negative if it is to the left of 0 on the number line.
note: + and  NotationA number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign or no sign at all.
A number is denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a minus sign.
PAGE	'10.3.3 Reading Signed NumbersThe plus and minus signs now have two meanings:'
The plus sign can denote the operation of addition or a positive number.
The minus sign can denote the operation of subtraction or a negative number.
To avoid any confusion between "sign" and "operation," it is preferable to read the sign of a number as "positive" or "negative." When "+" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "plus." When "" is used as an operation sign, it is read as "minus."
10.3.3.1 Sample Set ARead each expression so as to avoid confusion between "operation" and "sign."
Example 10.6
8 should be read as "negative eight" rather than "minus eight."
Example 10.7
4 + (2) should be read as "four plus negative two" rather than "four plus minus two."
Example 10.8
6 + (3)should be read as "negative six plus negative three" rather than "minus six plus minus
three."
Example 10.9
15(6)should be read as "negative fteen minus negative six" rather than "minus fteen minus
minus six." Example 10.10
5 + 7 should be read as "negative ve plus seven" rather than "minus ve plus seven." Example 10.11
0  2 should be read as "zero minus two."

PAGE	'10.3.4 Opposites'
OppositesOn the number line, each real number, other than zero, has an image on the opposite side of 0. For this reason, we say that each real number has an opposite. Opposites are the same distance from zero but have opposite signs.
The opposite of a real number is denoted by placing a negative sign directly in front of the number. Thus, if a is any real number, then a is its opposite.
note: The letter "a" is a variable. Thus, "a" need not be positive, and "a" need not be negative. If a is any real number, a is opposite a on the number line.
PAGE	'10.3.5 The Double-Negative Property'
The number a is opposite a on the number line. Therefore, (a) is opposite a on the number line. This means that
(a) = aFrom this property of opposites, we can suggest the double-negative property for real numbers.
Double-Negative Property:  (a) = a If a is a real number, then(a) = a



10.3.5.1 Sample Set BFind the opposite of each number.
Example 10.12
Ifa= 2,thena=2. Also,(a)=(2)=2.

		Geometric Denition of Absolute Value
		Algebraic Denition of Absolute Value 10.4.2 Geometric Denition of Absolute Value
Absolute Value-Geometric ApproachGeometric denition of absolute value:The absolute value of a number a, denoted | a |, is the distance from a to 0 on the number line.
Absolute value answers the question of "how far," and not "which way." The phrase "how far" implies "length" and length is always a nonnegative quantity. Thus, the absolute value of a number is a nonnegative number.
10.4.2.1 Sample Set A Determine each value.
Example 10.14!!!
| 4 |= 4
Example 10.15!!!
| 4 |= 4
Example 10.16!!!
| 0 |= 0This content is available online at <http://cnx.org/content/m35030/1.3/>.


Example 10.17
 | 5 |= 5. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute value
of 5." The absolute value of 5 is 5. Hence, negative the absolute value of 5 is -5.
Example 10.18
 | 3 |= 3. The quantity on the left side of the equal sign is read as "negative the absolute
value of -3." The absolute value of -3 is 3. Hence, negative the absolute value of -3 is  (3) = 3.

PAGE	'10.4.3 Algebraic Denition of Absolute Value'
From the problems in Section 10.4.2.1 (Sample Set A), we can suggest the following algebraic denition of absolute value. Note that the denition has two parts.
Absolute ValueAlgebraic Approach Algebraic denition of absolute valueThe absolute value of a number a is
a, ifa0
|a| = {a, if <0
The algebraic denition takes into account the fact that the number a could be either positive or zero (a  0) or negative (a < 0).
	1.	If the number a is positive or zero (a  0), the upper part of the denition applies. The upper part of the denition tells us that if the number enclosed in the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, the absolute value of the number is the number itself.
	2.	The lower part of the denition tells us that if the number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a negative number, the absolute value of the number is the opposite of the number. The opposite of a negative number is a positive number.
note: The denition says that the vertical absolute value lines may be eliminated only if we know whether the number inside is positive or negative.

# CHAPTER 10. SIGNED NUMBERS
10.4.3.1 Sample Set BUse the algebraic denition of absolute value to nd the following values.
Example 10.19
| 8 |. The number enclosed within the absolute value bars is a nonnegative number, so the upper
part of the denition applies. This part says that the absolute value of 8 is 8 itself.
| 8 |= 8
Example 10.20
| 3 |. The number enclosed within absolute value bars is a negative number, so the lower part of
the denition applies. This part says that the absolute value of -3 is the opposite of -3, which is  (3). By the denition of absolute value and the double-negative property,
| 3 |=  (3) = 3

PAGE	'10.5.2 Addition of Numbers with Like SignsThe addition of the two positive numbers 2 and 3 is performed on the number line as follows.'
Begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right. Since 3 is positive, move 3 more units to the right. We are now located at 5.
Thus, 2 + 3 = 5.
Summarizing, we have



(2 positive units) + (3 positive units) = (5 positive units)The addition of the two negative numbers -2 and -3 is performed on the number line as follows. Begin at 0, the origin.Since -2 is negative, move 2 units to the left.Since -3 is negative, move 3 more units to the left.We are now located at -5.
Thus, (2) + (3) = 5.Summarizing, we have(2 negative units) + (3 negative units) = (5 negative units) Observing these two examples, we can suggest these relationships: (positive number) + (positive number) = (positive number) (negative number) + (negative number) = (negative number)
Adding Numbers with the Same SignAddition of numbers with like sign:To add two real numbers that have the same sign, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign.

} Add these absolute values.
|9| = 94 + 9 = 13The common sign is .

PAGE	'10.5.3 Addition With Zero'
Addition with ZeroNotice that(0) + (a positive number) = (that same positive number). (0) + (a negative number) = (that same negative number).

The Additive Identity Is ZeroSince adding zero to a real number leaves that number unchanged, zero is called the additive identity.
PAGE	'10.5.4 Addition of Numbers with Unlike SignsThe addition 2 + (6), two numbers with unlike signs, can also be illustrated using the number line.'
Begin at 0, the origin.Since 2 is positive, move 2 units to the right.Since -6 is negative, move, from 2, 6 units to the left. We are now located at -4.
We can suggest a rule for adding two numbers that have unlike signs by noting that if the signs are disre- garded, 4 can be obtained by subtracting 2 from 6. But 2 and 6 are precisely the absolute values of 2 and


-6. Also, notice that the sign of the number with the larger absolute value is negative and that the sign of the resulting sum is negative.
Adding Numbers with Unlike SignsAddition of numbers with unlike signs: To add two real numbers that have unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate with this dierence the sign of the number with the larger absolute value.
10.5.4.1 Sample Set B Find the following sums.
Example 10.23
7 + (2)
|7| = 7 
Larger absolute value. Sign is positive.
|  2| = 2   
Smaller absolute value.

Subtract absolute values: 7  2 = 5. Attach the proper sign: "+."
Thus, 7 + (2) = +5 or 7 + (2) = 5. Example 10.24
3 + (11) |3| = 3
  
Smaller absolute value.
|  11| = 11   
Larger absolute value. Sign is negative.

Subtract absolute values: 11  3 = 8. Attach the proper sign: "."
Thus, 3 + (11) = 8.
Example 10.25
The morning temperature on a winter's day in Lake Tahoe was -12 degrees. The afternoon
temperature was 25 degrees warmer. What was the afternoon temperature? We need to nd 12 + 25.
|  12| = 12   
Smaller absolute value.
|25| = 25   
Larger absolute value. Sign is positive.

Subtract absolute values: 25  12 = 16. Attach the proper sign: "+."Thus, 12 + 25 = 13.

		Denition of Subtraction

We know from experience with arithmetic that the subtraction 5  2 produces 3, that is 5  2 = 3. We can suggest a rule for subtracting signed numbers by illustrating this process on the number line.
Begin at 0, the origin.
Since 5 is positive, move 5 units to the right.
Then, move 2 units to the left to get to 6. (This reminds us of addition with a negative number.)
From this illustration we can see that 5  2 is the same as 5 + (2). This leads us directly to the denition of subtraction.
Denition of SubtractionIf a and b are real numbers, ab is the same as a+(b), where b is the opposite of b.

Rules for Dividing Signed Numbers Dividing signed numbers:

1. To divide two real numbers that have the same sign, divide their absolute values. The quotient is positive.
(+) = (+) () = (+) (+) ()
2. To divide two real numbers that have opposite signs, divide their absolute values. The quotient is negative.
() = () (+) = () (+) ()

PAGE	'10.8.1 Summary of Key Concepts'
Variables and Constants (Section 10.2)A variable is a letter or symbol that represents any member of a set of two or more numbers. A constant is a letter or symbol that represents a specic number. For example, the Greek letter  (pi) represents the constant 3.14159 . . . .
The Real Number Line (Section 10.2)The real number line allows us to visually display some of the numbers in which we are interested.
Coordinate and Graph (Section 10.2)The number associated with a point on the number line is called the coordinate of the point. The point
associated with a number is called the graph of the number.
Real Number (Section 10.2)A real number is any number that is the coordinate of a point on the real number line.
Types of Real Numbers (Section 10.2)The set of real numbers has many subsets. The ones of most interest to us are:
The natural numbers: {1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}The whole numbers: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}The integers: {. . . ,-3,-2,-1,0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}The rational numbers: {All numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers.}
Positive and Negative Numbers (Section 10.3)A number is denoted as positive if it is directly preceded by a plus sign (+) or no sign at all. A number is
denoted as negative if it is directly preceded by a minus sign ().
Opposites (Section 10.3)Opposites are numbers that are the same distance from zero on the number line but have opposite signs.
The numbers a and a are opposites. Double-Negative Property (Section 10.3)
(a) = aAbsolute Value (Geometric) (Section 10.4)
The absolute value of a number a, denoted | a |, is the distance from a to 0 on the number line. Absolute Value (Algebraic) (Section 10.4)
a, ifa0 |a| = {
a, ifa<0Addition of Signed Numbers (Section 10.5)
To add two numbers with
1. like signs, add the absolute values of the numbers and associate with the sum the common sign.2. unlike signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value and associate with
the dierence the sign of the larger absolute value.This content is available online at <http://cnx.org/content/m35034/1.2/>.



# CHAPTER 10. SIGNED NUMBERS Addition with Zero (Section 10.5)
0 + (any number) = that particular number. Additive Identity (Section 10.5)
Since adding 0 to any real number leaves that number unchanged, 0 is called the additive identity. Denition of Subtraction (Section 10.6)
a  b = a + (b)
Subtraction of Signed Numbers (Section 10.6)To perform the subtraction a  b, add the opposite of b to a, that is, change the sign of b and follow the addition rules (Section 10.5).

PAGE	'11.2.2 Algebraic Expressions'

Numerical ExpressionIn arithmetic, a numerical expression results when numbers are connected by arithmetic operation signs (+, -,  , ). For example, 8+5, 49, 38, and 97 are numerical expressions.
Algebraic ExpressionIn algebra, letters are used to represent numbers, and an algebraic expression results when an arithmetic operation sign associates a letter with a number or a letter with a letter. For example, x + 8, 4  y , 3  x , x  7 , and x  y are algebraic expressions.
ExpressionsNumerical expressions and algebraic expressions are often referred to simply as expressions.
PAGE	'11.2.3 Terms and FactorsIn algebra, it is extremely important to be able to distinguish between terms and factors.'
Distinction Between Terms and FactorsTerms are parts of sums and are therefore connected by + signs. Factors are parts of products and are therefore separated by  signs.
note: While making the distinction between sums and products, we must remember that subtrac- tion and division are functions of these operations.
	1.	In some expressions it will appear that terms are separated by minus signs. We must keep in mind that subtraction is addition of the opposite, that is,x  y = x + (y)
	2.	In some expressions it will appear that factors are separated by division signs. We must keep in mind that x=x1=x1 y1yy
11.2.3.1 Sample Set AState the number of terms in each expression and name them.
Example 11.1
x + 4. In this expression, x and 4 are connected by a "+" sign. Therefore, they are terms. This
expression consists of two terms.
Example 11.2
y  8. The expression y  8 can be expressed as y + (8). We can now see that this expression
consists of the two terms y and 8.This content is available online at <http://cnx.org/content/m35038/1.2/>.


Rather than rewriting the expression when a subtraction occurs, we can identify terms more quickly by associating the + or - sign with the individual quantity.
Example 11.3
a + 7  b  m. Associating the sign with the individual quantities, we see that this expression consists of the four terms a, 7, b, m.
Example 11.4
5m  8n. This expression consists of the two terms, 5m and 8n. Notice that the term 5m is
composed of the two factors 5 and m. The term 8n is composed of the two factors 8 and n.
Example 11.5
3x. This expression consists of one term. Notice that 3x can be expressed as 3x + 0 or 3x 
1 (indicating the connecting signs of arithmetic). Note that no operation sign is necessary for multiplication.

PAGE	'11.2.4 CoecientsWe know that multiplication is a description of repeated addition. For example,'
57 describes 7+7+7+7+7
Suppose some quantity is represented by the letter x. The multiplication 5x describes x + x + x + x + x. It is now easy to see that 5x species 5 of the quantities represented by x. In the expression 5x, 5 is called the numerical coecient, or more simply, the coecient of x.
CoecientThe coecient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are.
Since constants alone do not record the number of some quantity, they are not usually considered as numerical coecients. For example, in the expression 7x + 2y  8z + 12, the coecient of
7x is 7. (There are 7 x's.)2y is 2. (There are 2 y 's.) 8z is 8. (There are 8z 's.)
The constant 12 is not considered a numerical coecient.

# CHAPTER 11. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS
1x = xWhen the numerical coecient of a variable is 1, we write only the variable and not the coecient. For example, we write x rather than 1x. It is clear just by looking at x that there is only one.
PAGE	'11.2.5 Numerical Evaluation'
We know that a variable represents an unknown quantity. Therefore, any expression that contains a variable represents an unknown quantity. For example, if the value of x is unknown, then the value of 3x + 5 is unknown. The value of 3x + 5 depends on the value of x.
Numerical EvaluationNumerical evaluation is the process of determining the numerical value of an algebraic expression by replacing the variables in the expression with specied numbers.
11.2.5.1 Sample Set BFind the value of each expression.
Example 11.6
2x + 7y, if x = 4 and y = 2
Replace x with 4 and y with 2.
2x+7y = 2(4)+7(2) = 8+14
=6Thus, when x =   4 and y = 2, 2x + 7y = 6.
Example 11.7
5a +8b,ifa=6andb=3.

b 12Replace a with 6 and b with 3.
5a +8b = 5(6) +8(3) b 12 3 12
= 30+  24
= 10 + (2) = 12
Thus,whena=6andb=3, 5a +8b =12. b 12
Example 11.8
6 (2a  15b), if a = 5 and b = 1
Replace a with 5 and b with 1.
6(2a15b) = 6(2(5)15(1)) = 6(10+15)
= 6(5) = 30

Example 11.9
3x2  2x + 1, if x = 4
Replace x with 4.
3x2 2x+1 = 3(4)2 2(4)+1 = 3162(4)+1
= 488+1 = 41
Thus, when x = 4, 3x2  2x + 1 = 41. Example 11.10
x2  4, if x = 3 Replace x with 3.
x2  4 = 3  4 Be careful to square only the 3. The exponent 2 is connected only to 3, not -3 = 94

From our examination of terms in Section 11.2, we know that like terms are terms in which the variable parts are identical. Like terms is an appropriate name since terms with identical variable parts and dierent numerical coecients represent dierent amounts of the same quantity. When we are dealing with quantities of the same type, we may combine them using addition and subtraction.
Simplifying an Algebraic ExpressionAn algebraic expression may be simplied by combining like terms.
This concept is illustrated in the following examples.
	1.	8 records + 5 records = 13 records.Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. We have combined quantities of the same type.
	2.	8 records + 5 records + 3 tapes = 13 records + 3 tapes. Eight and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. Thus, we have 13 of one type and 3 of another type. We have combined only quantities of the same type.
	3.	Suppose we let the letter x represent "record." Then, 8x + 5x = 13x. The terms 8x and 5x are like terms. So, 8 and 5 of the same type give 13 of that type. We have combined like terms.
	4.	Suppose we let the letter x represent "record" and y represent "tape." Then, 8x + 5x + 3y = 13x + 5y We have combined only the like terms.
After observing the problems in these examples, we can suggest a method for simplifying an algebraic expression by combining like terms.
Combining Like TermsLike terms may be combined by adding or subtracting their coecients and axing the result to the common variable.

 Combining Like Terms

11.3.2.1 Sample Set ASimplify each expression by combining like terms.
Example 11.12
2m + 6m  4m. All three terms are alike. Combine their coecients and ax this result to m: 2 + 6  4 = 4.
Thus, 2m + 6m  4m = 4m . Example 11.13
5x + 2y  9y. The terms 2y and 9y are like terms. Combine their coecients: 2  9 = 7. Thus, 5x + 2y  9y = 5x  7y .

Addition/Subtraction Property of EqualityFrom this, we can suggest the addition/subtraction property of equality. Given any equation,
1. We can obtain an equivalent equation by adding the same number to both sides of the equation.2. We can obtain an equivalent equation by subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation.
The Idea Behind Equation SolvingThe idea behind equation solving is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Signs of operation (+, -, ,) are used to associate two numbers. For example, in the expression 5 + 3, the numbers 5 and 3 are associated by addition. An association can be undone by performing the opposite operation. The addition/subtraction property of equality can be used to undo an association that is made by addition or subtraction.
Subtraction is used to undo an addition. Addition is used to undo a subtraction.The procedure is illustrated in the problems of .
# CHAPTER 11. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS
11.4.4.1 Sample Set BUse the addition/subtraction property of equality to solve each equation.
Example 11.20
x + 4 = 6.
4 is associated with x by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 4 from both sides.
x+44=64 x+0=2 x=2
Check: When x = 2, x + 4 becomes
The solution to x + 4 = 6 is x = 2. Example 11.21

Check: When m = 13, becomes
a true statement.
The solution to m  8 = 5 is m = 13.
Example 11.22
3  5 = y  2 + 8. Before we use the addition/subtraction property, we should simplify as much
as possible.
3  5 = y  2 + 8 8 = y + 6
6 is associated with y by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 6 from both sides.
8  6 = y + 6  6
14 = y + 0

Check: When y = 14, 3  5 = y  2 + 8

becomes
, a true statement.
The solution to 3  5 = y  2 + 8 is y = 14. Example 11.23
5a + 1 + 6a = 2. Begin by simplifying the left side of the equation. 5a + 1 + 6a = 2
  
5+6=1a + 1 = 2 1 is associated with a by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 1 from both
sides.
a + 1  1 = 2  1 a + 0 = 3a = 3
Check: When a = 3, 5a + 1 + 6a = 2 becomes
, a true statement.
The solution to 5a + 1 + 6a = 2 is a = 3.
Example 11.24
7k  4 = 6k + 1. In this equation, the variable appears on both sides. We need to isolate it on one
side. Although we can choose either side, it will be more convenient to choose the side with the larger coecient. Since 8 is greater than 6, we'll isolate k on the left side.
7k  4 = 6k + 1 Since 6k represents +6k, subtract 6k from each side. 7k  4  6k = 6k + 1  6k
     
76=1 66=0k  4 = 1 4 is associated with k by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 4 to both sides.
k4+4=1+4 k=5
Check: When k = 5, 7k  4 = 6k + 1 becomes
a true statement.



# CHAPTER 11. ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS
The solution to 7k  4 = 6k + 1 is k = 5.
Example 11.25
8 + x = 5. -8 is associated with x by addition. Undo the by subtracting -8 from both sides.
Subtracting -8 we get  (8) =+8. We actually add 8 to both sides. 8 + x + 8 = 5 + 8x = 13Check: When x = 13
8 + x = 5 becomes

Having examined solving equations using the addition/subtraction and the multiplication/division principles of equality, we can combine these techniques to solve more complicated equations.
When beginning to solve an equation such as 6x  4 = 16, it is helpful to know which property of equality to use rst, addition/subtraction or multiplication/division. Recalling that in equation solving we are trying to isolate the variable (disassociate numbers from it), it is helpful to note the following.
To associate numbers and letters, we use the order of operations.
1. Multiply/divide 2. Add/subtract
To undo an association between numbers and letters, we use the order of operations in reverse.
1. Add/subtract 2. Multiply/divide
11.5.3.1 Sample Set BSolve each equation. (In these example problems, we will not show the checks.)
Example 11.31
6x  4 = 16
-4 is associated with x by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 4 to both sides. 6x4+4 = 16+4
6x = 126 is associated with x by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6
6x = 12 66
x = 2
Example 11.32
8k + 3=  45.
3 is associated with k by addition. Undo the association by subtracting 3 from both sides. 8k + 3  3=  45  3
8k=  48-8 is associated with k by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by -8.
8k = 48 8 8
k=6Example 11.33
5m  6  4m = 4m  8 + 3m. Begin by solving this equation by combining like terms.
m6 = 7m8 Choose a side on which to isolate m. Since 7 is greater than 1, we'll isolate m on the right side.Subtract m from both sides.
m  6  m = 7m  8  m 6 = 6m8
8 is associated with m by subtraction. Undo the association by adding 8 to both sides.
6 + 8 = 6m  8 + 8 2 = 6m
6 is associated with m by multiplication. Undo the association by dividing both sides by 6. 2 = 6m Reduce.

1=m 3
Notice that if we had chosen to isolate m on the left side of the equation rather than the right side, we would have proceeded as follows:
m  6 = 7m  8Subtract 7m from both sides.



# CHAPTER 11.
ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS AND EQUATIONS
6m6=8Add 6 to both sides,
6m6+6=8+6 6m=2
Divide both sides by -6.
6m = 2 6 6
m=1 3

This is the same result as with the previous approach. Example 11.34
8x=2 7
7 is associated with x by division. Undo the association by multiplying both sides by 7. )78x =7(2)

We are now in a position to solve some applied problems using algebraic methods. The problems we shall solve are intended as logic developers. Although they may not seem to reect real situations, they do serve as a basis for solving more complex, real situation, applied problems. To solve problems algebraically, we will use the ve-step method.
Strategy for Reading Word ProblemsWhen solving mathematical word problems, you may wish to apply the following "reading strategy." Read the problem quickly to get a feel for the situation. Do not pay close attention to details. At the rst reading, too much attention to details may be overwhelming and lead to confusion and discouragement. After the rst, brief reading, read the problem carefully in phrases. Reading phrases introduces information more slowly and allows us to absorb and put together important information. We can look for the unknown quantity by reading one phrase at a time.
Five-Step Method for Solving Word Problems
1. Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity.2. Translate the words to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Draw a picture if possible.3. Solve the equation.4. Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement, not equation, of the problem. 5. Write a conclusion.
If it has been your experience that word problems are dicult, then follow the ve-step method carefully. Most people have trouble with word problems for two reasons:
1. They are not able to translate the words to mathematical symbols. (See Section 11.5.)



2. They neglect step 1. After working through the problem phrase by phrase, to become familiar with the situation,

Numerical Expression (Section 11.2)A numerical expression results when numbers are associated by arithmetic operation signs. The expres- sions 3+5, 92, 56 and 85 are numerical expressions.
Algebraic Expressions (Section 11.2)When an arithmetic operation sign connects a letter with a number or a letter with a letter, an algebraic expression results. The expressions 4x + 1, x  5, 7x  6y, and 4x  3 are algebraic expressions.
Terms and Factors (Section 11.2)Terms are parts of sums and are therefore separated by addition (or subtraction) signs. In the expres- sion, 5x  2y, 5x and 2y are the terms. Factors are parts of products and are therefore separated by multiplication signs. In the expression 5a, 5 and a are the factors.
Coecients (Section 11.2)The coecient of a quantity records how many of that quantity there are. In the expression 7x, the coecient 7 indicates that there are seven x's.
Numerical Evaluation (Section 11.2)Numerical evaluation is the process of determining the value of an algebraic expression by replacing the variables in the expression with specied values.
Combining Like Terms (Section 11.3)An algebraic expression may be simplied by combining like terms. To combine like terms, we simply add or subtract their coecients then ax the variable. For example 4x + 9x = (4 + 9) x = 13x.
Equation (Section 11.4)An equation is a statement that two expressions are equal. The statements 5x + 1 = 3 and 4x + 4 = 2 are

equations. The expressions represent the same quantities.
Conditional Equation (Section 11.4)A conditional equation is an equation whose truth depends on the value selected for the variable. The equation 3x = 9 is a conditional equation since it is only true on the condition that 3 is selected for x.
Solutions and Solving an Equation (Section 11.4)The values that when substituted for the variables make the equation true are called the solutions of the equation.An equation has been solved when all its solutions have been found.
Equivalent Equations (Section 11.4)Equations that have precisely the same solutions are called equivalent equations. The equations 6y = 18 and y = 3 are equivalent equations.
Addition/Subtraction Property of Equality (Section 11.4) Given any equation, we can obtain an equivalent equation by
1. adding the same number to both sides, or2. subtracting the same number from both sides.


Solving x +a =b and xa =b (Section 11.4) To solve x + a = b, subtract a from both sides.
x+a=b x+aa=ba x=ba
Tosolve xa=b,add atobothsides.
xa=b xa+a=b+a x=b+a
Multiplication/Division Property of Equality (Section 11.5) Given any equation, we can obtain an equivalent equation by
1. multiplying both sides by the same nonzero number, that is, if c = 0, a = b and ac = bc are equivalent.
2. dividing both sides by the same nonzero number, that is, if c = 0, a = b and a = b are equivalent. cc
Solving ax = b and x = b (Section 11.5) a
To solve ax = b, a = 0, divide both sides by a. ax = b

Translating Words to Mathematics (Section 11.6)In solving applied problems, it is important to be able to translate phrases and sentences to mathematical expressions and equations.
The Five-Step Method for Solving Applied Problems (Section 11.7)To solve problems algebraically, it is a good idea to use the following ve-step procedure. After working your way through the problem carefully, phrase by phrase:
	1.	Let x (or some other letter) represent the unknown quantity.
	2.	Translate the phrases and sentences to mathematical symbols and form an equation. Draw a picture if possible.
	3.	Solve this equation.
	4.	Check the solution by substituting the result into the original statement of the problem.
	5.	Write a conclusion.


x=To solve x = b, a = 0, multiply both sides by a.

x a
=b ax = ab
