		Graphing Whole Numbers 1.2.2 Numbers and NumeralsWe begin our study of introductory mathematics by examining its most basic building block, the number. NumberA number is a concept. It exists only in the mind. The earliest concept of a number was a thought that allowed people to mentally picture the size of some collection of objects. To write down the number being conceptualized, a numeral is used. NumeralA numeral is a symbol that represents a number. In common usage today we do not distinguish between a number and a numeral. In our study of introductory mathematics, we will follow this common usage. 1.2.2.1 Sample Set A The following are numerals. In each case, the rst represents the number four, the second represents the num- ber one hundred twenty-three, and the third, the number one thousand ve. These numbers are represented in dierent ways.
		Hindu-Arabic numerals 4, 123, 1005
		Roman numerals IV, CXXIII, MV
		Egyptian numerals 1.2.2.2 Practice Set A Exercise 1.2.1Do the phrases "four," "one hundred twenty-three," and "one thousand ve" qualify as numerals? Yes or no? 2

Hindu-Arabic Numeration SystemOur society uses the Hindu-Arabic numeration system. This system of numeration began shortly before the third century when the Hindus invented the numerals
Leonardo FibonacciAbout a thousand years later, in the thirteenth century, a mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa introduced the system into Europe. It was then popularized by the Arabs. Thus, the name, Hindu-Arabic numeration system.

DigitsThe Hindu-Arabic numerals 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 are called digits. We can form any number in the number system by selecting one or more digits and placing them in certain positions. Each position has a particular value. The Hindu mathematician who devised the system about A.D. 500 stated that "from place to place each is ten times the preceding."
Base Ten Positional SystemsIt is for this reason that our number system is called a positional number system with base ten.
CommasWhen numbers are composed of more than three digits, commas are sometimes used to separate the digits into groups of three.
PeriodsThese groups of three are called periods and they greatly simplify reading numbers.
In the Hindu-Arabic numeration system, a period has a value assigned to each or its three positions, and the values are the same for each period. The position values are
Thus, each period contains a position for the values of one, ten, and hundred. Notice that, in looking from right to left, the value of each position is ten times the preceding. Each period has a particular name.
As we continue from right to left, there are more periods. The ve periods listed above are the most common, and in our study of introductory mathematics, they are sucient.
The following diagram illustrates our positional number system to trillions. (There are, to be sure, other periods.)
# CHAPTER 1. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF WHOLE NUMBERS
In our positional number system, the value of a digit is determined by its position in the number.
1.2.4.1 Sample Set B
Example 1.1
Find the value of 6 in the number 7,261.
Since 6 is in the tens position of the units period, its value is 6 tens.
6 tens = 60
Example 1.2
Find the value of 9 in the number 86,932,106,005.
Since 9 is in the hundreds position of the millions period, its value is 9 hundred millions.
9 hundred millions = 9 hundred million
Example 1.3
Find the value of 2 in the number 102,001.
Since 2 is in the ones position of the thousands period, its value is 2 one thousands. 2 one thousands = 2 thousand
1.2.4.2 Practice Set B
Exercise 1.2.2
Find the value of 5 in the number 65,000.
Exercise 1.2.3
Find the value of 4 in the number 439,997,007,010.
Exercise 1.2.4
Find the value of 0 in the number 108.
